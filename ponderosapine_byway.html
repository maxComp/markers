The Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway starts in Boise. It follows Idaho 21 
north to the historic mining town of Idaho City, where you can still 
pan for gold in a nearby stream bed. Campgrounds and fishing 
opportunities dot the route from Idaho City to Lowman and along the 
South Fork of the Payette River, as you slowly climb along the 
byway's northeasterly route.<br><br>
At the cutoff road to Grandjean, the roadway leaves the Payette 
River and squeezes between two of Idaho's wilderness areas. On 
the right, the Sawtooth Wilderness and its 217,000 pristine acres 
of coniferous forest lands and wilderness lakes. To the left, the 
Salmon-Challis National Forest, entryway to the 2.3-million-acre 
Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, with more contiguous 
acres of roadless wilderness than anywhere else in the lower 48 
states.<br><br>
From Banner Summit, one of Idaho's highest at 7,056 feet, you begin 
a descent into the town of Stanley. As the roadway grooves through 
the steep foothills and thick forest, you can catch glimpses of the 
Sawtooth Mountains ahead; finally, as you drop into Stanley, 
they come into full, magnificent view.
