For motorists, it can be a distracting drive as the river crashes 
and tumbles its way over the rocks through this narrow river valley. 
Depending on where you are on the river, it can be a mild ripple or a 
wild torrent. There are occasional pull-offs where you can view the 
wilder parts and treat your senses to the sight, sound, smell, and 
rhythm of Idaho's famous whitewater.
<br><br>
Along this byway are some great locations for camping, hiking, boating,
fishing, and guided float trips. Outfitters offer river excursions 
that range from half-day to three-day outings in rafts or kayaks.

The mountain resort town of McCall sits next to Payette Lake and is a
great year-round getaway. It is particularly famous for the annual 
Winter Carnival, when the streets are lined with ice sculptures.
