Most early Bear Lake settlers came from
Britain. <br><br>Ann Elizabeth Walmsley Palmer
was the first woman convert to the LDS
Church in Europe.
Born in Preston, England, August 24,
1806, she was baptized July 30, 1837. An
invalid, she was carried into the water,
but walked out unaided. After coming to
Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1842, she drove an ox
team to Utah in 1849 and settled there in
1863. She died here November 2, 1890.
Through faith she gained the strength to
overcome trials and to achieve triumphs.
