An ambitious railroad project to a high
Seven Devils copper mine (elevation
6,800 feet) created a lot of excitement
here in 1898-99.<br><br>
This would have been Idaho's highest
mountain railroad if funding had been
available to complete it. Construction
began near a canyon rim more than a
vertical mile above the Snake River.
Although it never got anywhere, that
grade still can be seen near Kinney Point.
Remains of an old mining smelter at
Landore also survive from that time.
