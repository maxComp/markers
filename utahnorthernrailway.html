Directly west of this highway, an old 1878
railway grade is still visible, although
trains have not used it since 1890.<br><br>
Jay Gould - a nationally prominent
financier and Union Pacific owner -
extended Utah Northern service north
from Franklin to Montana by 1880. A
narrow-gauge line until 1887, it helped
build up Cache Valley and accounted for
many new Idaho cities and towns farther
north. But small, wood-burning locomotives
had a hard time ascending this hill.
After a more direct route four miles west
of here was completed, service north of
Preston was abandoned on this grade.
