Through this canyon once puffed the
wood-burning locomotives of the narrow-gauge Utah Northern Railway.<br><br>
Construction, undertaken by a Mormon
co-op, came northward from a junction
with the transcontinental line, but
stopped in 1874 at Franklin on the Utah/Idaho border. Jay Gould, famous financier
of the Union Pacific, took over in 1877.
Trains were passing here the next summer, and the rails reached Montana in
1880. New life for eastern Idaho followed
the shrieking whistles of those little Utah
Northern trains.
