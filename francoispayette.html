This park memorializes the pacific northwest's most successful 
french canadian fur trapper for whom this city and county are
named.
<br><br>
In 1812 he came from Quebec to the Columbia at the age of 18.
 Moving inland to the Snake country in 1818 he trapped on the
 Payette river, which was named for him that year. For a 
decade prior to his retirement in 1844, he managed Fort 
Boise, 20 miles south of here. "A merry, fat old gentleman" 
he was noted for his kindness to Oregon Trail emigrants who 
found him exceedingly polite, courteous and hospitable.
