A landmark toll bridge spanned the Snake
River at this rocky site in 1865, replacing
the Eagle Rock Ferry; nine miles upstream.<br><br>
James Madison Taylor (a relative of
Presidents Madison and Taylor and a
founder of Denver, Colorado) settled here
in 1864 to develop an improved route for
his freight line from Salt Lake to
Montana's new gold mines. After his
bridge was built, telegraph service
reached here, July 16, 1866, and Eagle
Rock (as Idaho Falls was known until
1890) became a regional transportation
center. A railroad bridge was built
adjacent to Taylor's Bridge in 1879.
