In 1810, Andrew Henry and a party of trappers from St. Louis 
established a winter outpost about six miles west of here. <br><br>
Driven from their upper Missouri beaver camp by hostile 
Blackfeet Indians, they expanded their operation from 
United States territory into Oregon - a land with only a few 
British posts at that time. They built cabins and wintered 
here in deep snow. Game was scarce, and they had little 
to eat except horses. So they abandoned this area, and Henry 
took only 40 packs of beaver pelts - a  thin catch - back to 
St. Louis after a season's work.
