This shortcut to the California gold fields, followed by most of 
the 49'ers, came out of the hills to the east and joined the old 
California Trail just about here. <br><br>Opened by "Messers. 
Hudspeth & Myers, of the Jackson County Missouri 
Company," who reached here on July 24, 1849, this new 
route was mistakenly thought to save nearly 100 miles 
over the old way along the Snake River to the north. From 
here, the 49'rs struck southwest for California and golden 
riches.
