Levi Smiley found gold on Smiley Creek in 1878, and E.M. 
Wilson discovered a still richer lode 8 miles above here near 
Vienna, on June 4, 1879. <br><br>Before shutting down in 
1886, Vienna was a  thriving mining camp with a $200,000 
twenty-stamp mill to crush gold ore nearby. Miners here 
supported 14 saloons, 3 stores, 2 meat markets, a bank, a hotel, 
a sawmill, 2 livery stables, 6 restaurants, and, in 1882, a 
newspaper. More than 200 buildings disappeared when 
Vienna became a ghost town shortly after 1900.
