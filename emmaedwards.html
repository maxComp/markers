A talented artist, Emma Edwards went to
work in 1890 to design Idaho's state seal
when she was only 18 years old.<br><br>
Although her father had moved to
California after serving as governor of
Missouri (1844-1848), Emma preferred to
spend much of her time in Idaho. After
her marriage to John G. Green, a Boise
Basin miner, they took up a land claim
along Emma Creek and Green Creek in
1906 and lived here for many summers.
Her seal design designated syringa, which
blooms on these hills, as Idaho's state
flower.
