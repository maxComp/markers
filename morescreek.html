More's Creek is named for J. Marion More,
leader of the party of miners who founded
Idaho City, October 7, I862.<br><br>
Like most of Idaho's early miners, he
came originally from the South. Unlike
most of them, he struck it rich. During
the Idaho gold rush, he had profitable
investments in many important mining
camps. Hardly anyone else did as much to
build Idaho during the early days.
