The Weiser Valley provided an abundant
environment for early hunters and food
gatherers.<br><br>
Archaeological excavation along Monroe
Creek in conjunction with U.S. 95
realignment yielded one of the most
significant prehistoric sites in the region.
Spear and arrow points and radiocarbon
dates suggest the site was occupied for
11,000 years. Inhabitants hunted deer,
mountain goat, and rabbit and gathered
salmon, roots, berries, and seeds. Artifacts
were found 10 feet below the ground
surface.
