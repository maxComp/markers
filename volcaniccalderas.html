Some two million years ago, massive
eruptions of hot rock boiled for 60 miles
from this high rim through Yellowstone
Park.<br><br>
An exceptionally large crater remained
when that lava surface collapsed. Another
smaller caldera followed north of here
about 1.3 million years ago. Yellowstone's
geysers and hot springs continue to spout
as remnants of those volcanic displays
formed as underground rock gradually
moved westward across a tremendous
source of interior heat.
