In 1811, the Hunt party likened the
terrific torrent of the Snake River three
miles east of here to a boiling caldron,
adding the old Scottish word "linn,"
meaning a waterfall.<br><br>
They had lost a man and a canoe in a
roaring chute upstream. Finding worse
water ahead, they abandoned river travel.
Next year, another explorer said of
Caldron Linn, "Its terrific appearance
beggars all description." Almost
undisturbed by later farming, it survives
as an exceptional natural spectacle.
