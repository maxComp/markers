More than a century ago, miners faced a hopeless problem of 
hauling copper ore to this canyon for shipment to smelters. <br><br>
They started with Albert Kleinschmidt's road grade down from their mine, more than 
a vertical mile above the Snake River about 30 miles 
downstream from here. After a steamboat failed in 1891, a 
railroad (now under water) was built past here to their river 
landing. That did not work either. Large ore trucks finally 
solved the problem in 1968.
