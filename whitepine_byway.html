The White Pine Scenic Byway begins on Idaho 3 at Interstate 90 near
 Cataldo, home to Old Mission of the Sacred Heart. Built in the 
mid-1800's, the mission itself is the oldest building still standing in 
Idaho; travelers can also visit the nearby Parish House and two 
historic cemeteries on the grounds, and enjoy the visitor center, 
walking trails, and picnic areas.<br><br>
From Cataldo, the White Pine Scenic Byway passes through the lush
 forests of Idaho's timber country and the numerous lakes and 
marshlands of the lower Coeur d'Alene River to the town of St. 
Maries, the Hughes House Museum, and other attractions. The 
byway then crosses the picturesque St. Maries and St. Joe rivers, 
the latter of which is the highest navigable river in the world.
<br><br>
The route continues on Idaho 6, meandering south through the town 
of Emida, and the St. Joe National Forest which boasts the largest 
stand of White Pine in the country. The byway winds through 
rolling hills of the Palouse region to the historic town of Potlatch, 
once site of the largest white pine lumber mill in the world.
