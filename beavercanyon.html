After Montana's gold rushes began in
1862, thousands of miners came past
here, and a Beaver Canyon stage station
was built here.<br><br>
Freighters and travelers on stage lines
from Salt Lake to Montana stopped at this
station until Utah and Northern Railway
service reached here in 1879. Large
ranches also were supplied here until
1897, when they decided to move their
Beaver Canyon town to a better site at
Spencer.
