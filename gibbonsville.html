British investment in a large Gibbonsville
mine after 1880 made this an important
gold camp until 1899.<br><br>
Discovery of a major lode here in 1877
and construction of a good wagon road
to a Utah and Northern Railway terminal
in Montana brought prosperity when
mining was not suspended because of
litigation. With close to 100 buildings,
two sawmills, a roller mill, five stamp
mills, a newspaper and six to eight
saloons, Gibbonsville produced about
$2 million in gold.
