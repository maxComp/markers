Very few Indians survived an attack here
when the California volunteers trapped
and wiped out the Cache Valley Shoshoni.<br><br>
Friction between the whites and these
Indians, who had suffered from too many
years of close contact with fur hunters,
led P.E. Connor to set out from Salt Lake
on a cold winter campaign. The Shoshoni
had a strong position along Battle Creek
Canyon just north of here. With a loss of
about 400, they met the greatest Indian
disaster in the entire West, January 29,
1863.
