On September 9 & 10,1860, The Utter wagon train engaged in
a  life- and - death struggle with attacking indians.<br><br>
The assault on the wagon train of forty-four emigrants
led by Elijah P. Utter just north of here resulted in the 
deaths of six men, two women, and three children. 
Indian casualties were estimated at between 25 and 30. 
Survivors followed the Snake River to near the mouth 
of the Owyhee River. When rescued by the Army 15 
days later, only fifteen had survived the ordeal of 
hunger and deprivation. No other Oregon Trail 
wagon train suffered greater losses.
