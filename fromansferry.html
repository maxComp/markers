In 1888, George Froman built a ferry
about a mile downstream from here. It
operated until a bridge was built here in
1921.<br><br>
The ferry barge was connected by ropes to
a pulley that slid along a cable spanning
the river. By angling the barge into the
swift current, the ferryman could make it
across the stream in either direction with
no other power. Ferries of this type were a
common solution to the transportation
problem imposed on the pioneers by
Western rivers. There were several others
not far upstream.
