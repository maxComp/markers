When John C. Fremont came this way
mapping emigrant roads in 1843, he
found an important Indian village at
Fishing Falls (Kanaka Rapids) about four
miles above here.<br><br>
He reported that native salmon spearers
there were "unusually gay .. . fond of
laughter; and in apparent good nature and
merry character .. . entirely different from
the Indians we had been accustomed to
see." As the Snake River's highest salmon
cascades, Fishing Falls was included on
many early Western maps.
