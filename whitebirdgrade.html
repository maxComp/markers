<p>
For 60 years after construction was
completed in 1915, the White Bird Grade
(across the valley) served as Idaho's only
north-south highway.<br><br>
Many tortuous curves and switch backs which,
if placed together made 37
complete circles - let the old road climb
2,900 feet in 14 miles. Gaining an
elevation of 4,429 feet at its summit, that
route represented a significant engineering
and construction achievement. This
new grade did not replace it until 1975.
