In 1848, Pegleg Smith started a trading
post on the Oregon Trail at Big Timber on
the Bear River about a mile northwest of
here.<br><br>
Some travelers called it Fort Smith,
though it had only four log cabins and
some Indian lodges. Packing a plow and
tools from Salt Lake City, Smith (a
mountain man who had to amputate his
own leg 20 years before) tried unsuccessfully to raise crops. But he did a big
business when the California gold rush of
1849 brought thousands past here. The
49'rs reported that he had many horses
and cattle and was making $100 a day.
