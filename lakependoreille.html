<p>
When the last of the continental ice
sheets blocked this valley, a great lake
extended over 200 miles into Montana.<br><br>
Ice as high as the mountain ridges held
back water as deep as 800 to 1,000 feet at
Missoula, 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. At
times this lake cut through the ice dam
and came back. Finally, the climate turned
warm and the great ice sheet melted. Lake
Pend Oreille is a small remnant of that
glacial action.
