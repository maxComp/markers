In 1907, Nathaniel W. Lowman settled
here, and four years later, when he started
a post office in his large log house, this
community was named for him.<br><br>
Only a few scattered settlers lived here
then. Lowman got all its supplies once a
year from a large freight wagon over a
state road built in 1894 to provide access
to north Idaho. This highway followed in
1939. Eventually a one-room schoolhouse
was moved here from Garden Valley. It
still serves Lowman.<br><br>
