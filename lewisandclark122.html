<p>Hoping for an easy river trip to the
Pacific, William Clark explored the first
few miles of the rugged canyon of the
Salmon River below here late in August
1805.<br><br>
His small advance party camped near here
with poor but friendly Indians. Clark
reported that the Salmon "is almost one
continued rapid," and that passage "with
canoes is entirely impossible." So the
expedition had to buy packhorses and go
110 miles north to an Indian trail across
the mountains.
