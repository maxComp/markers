The organization of Idaho Territory was
proclaimed in Lewiston July 10, 1863,
and the first two legislatures met here.<br><br>
When Lewiston served as the capital,
Idaho Territory included Montana
and practically all of Wyoming - an
area much larger than Texas. Then in
1864, after Montana was established as a
separate territory and most of Wyoming
was attached to Dakota, the governor and
legislature decided to locate the capital of
Idaho in Boise, where it has been ever
since.<br><br>
