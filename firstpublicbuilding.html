In 1870, Brigham Young appointed Ezra T. Clark, David
Hess and Nicholas Barkdull to colonize this area.<br><br>
Originally known as Twin Creeks, Joseph C. Rich surveyed
the site in 1871.  In 1872, the new settlement was named
Georgetown in honor of George O. Cannon. The first public
building used as a church, school and community center is
situated 1 block south and 1/2 block west of here. In 1966
the building was given to the Daughters of Utah Pioneers
and is now a pioneer Relic Hall.
