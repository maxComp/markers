This roaring metropolis was founded
early in October 1862, about 10 weeks
after gold was discovered in Boise Basin.<br><br>
By the next summer, this was the largest
city in the Northwest, with 6,275 people
- 5,691 of them men! Families followed,
and respectable businesses, schools,
libraries, good theaters, churches and
fraternal orders soon came. The town
survived several diasterous fires and
remained an important mining center
until the war shut down gold production
in 1942.<br><br>
