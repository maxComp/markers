Charged with hacking a prominent local merchant to pieces, 
five Chinese were hanged here by vigilantes September 18, 
1885. <br><br>They were just setting out on a long, hard 
240-mile trip from Pierce to face trial at the county seat in 
Murray when the vigilantes struck. A large group of armed, 
masked men forced the deputy sheriff and his posse to give 
up the Chinese prisoners and to return to Pierce. A marked 
trail leads 365 feet from here to the site where this incident 
occurred.
