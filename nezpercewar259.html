After the Clearwater battle on the heights
above here, July 11-12, 1877, the Indians
crossed the Lolo Trail to Montana.<br><br>
Advancing northward along the high
ground with 600 troops and artillery,
General 0.0. Howard found the Indian
camp on the flat across the river. But 24
brave Indians blocked his advance and
100 more pinned him in rifle pits for a
day. Then the Indians, camp and all,
moved slowly northward past Kamiah,
while Howard followed without fighting.
There the Indians decided to move east
away from the troops.
