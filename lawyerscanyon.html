Named for the Nez Perce Indian leader
who served as head chief, 1848-71, and
who lived near the lower end of the
canyon.<br><br>
Called "The Lawyer" by early fur traders
for his exceptional talents in languages
and oratory, he was a friend of the whites.
He had learned English before the
missionaries came in 1836 and helped
them prepare dictionaries and translate
the Bible into Nez Perce. He played an
important part in all the treaties negotiated
with his people before his death in
1876, a year before the Nez Perce war.
