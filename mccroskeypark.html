Dedicated in memory of pioneer women,
Mary Minerva McCroskey State Park has
a forested skyline drive that offers
spectacular views of forests , farms and
distant mountains.<br><br>
Virgil T. McCroskey devoted his life to
preserving trees and scenery. Here he
purchased 4 ,500 acres of cedar, pine and
fir. He donated and endowed this magnificent
state park in 1954 and maintained
and enlarged it for 16 more years until his
death at age 94.<br><br>
