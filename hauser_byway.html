<b>Idaho for the Curious</b><br>Cort Conley<br>Page 288
<br><br>
Sometime after the gold and silver strikes in north Idaho, Daniel 
Corbin at the request of his good friend and governor of Montana, 
Samuel T. Hauser, came to north Idaho to look into the possibility 
of building a railroad into the Coeur d'Alene mining district.
<br><br>
Corbin built a branch line on the Northern Pacific Railroad, which is 
now Hauser Junction.  The line went through what is now Post Falls 
and on to the steamboat docks in Coeur d'Alene. Completed in 1886, it 
was approximately 13+ miles long and was called Spokane Falls and 
Idaho Railroad.  It is believed that Hauser Junction was named at the
 time the branch was completed by Daniel Chase Corbin in honor of 
his good friend and business partner who was appointed governor of 
Montana Territory in 1885 by President Cleveland. 
<br><br>
Samuel Thomas Hauser, born January 10, 1833, died in 1914. It 
would then follow that the lake and the Village would be named 
Hauser.  Hauser Lake Village was incorporated May 12, 1947.  
Sometime later the State said, "Those who call themselves villages 
shall now call themselves cities".
