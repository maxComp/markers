Designed by one of Brigham Young's sons,
this imposing Romanesque tabernacle was
built between 1884 and 1889 by skilled
local craftsmen.<br><br>
Swiss stonemasons cut and carved red
sandstone that horse and ox teams hauled
from a canyon 18 miles away. In winter,
sled-loads of rock were pulled over ice
across Bear Lake. Shingles and other
lumber came from nearby forests. After a
century of use, this unaltered monument
remains as a reminder of pioneer achievement.
