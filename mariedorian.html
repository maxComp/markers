An Iowa Indian who came through here
with Wilson Price Hunt's fur trappers in
1811, Marie Dorian spent an incredible
winter in this region in 1814.<br><br>
She and her two infant children were the
sole survivors of a mid-January Bannock
Indian clash at John Reed's fur trade post
four miles west of here. So they had to set
out with two horses on a 200-mile retreat
through deep mountain snow. Finally, a
Columbia River band of Walla Walla
Indians rescued them in April.
