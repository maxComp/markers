<p>
Since 1949, more nuclear reactors -
more than 50 of them - have been built
on this plain than anywhere else in the
world.<br><br>
This 900-square-mile Idaho National
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory
is the birthplace of the nuclear Navy.
Commercial power reactor prototypes,
including reactors that breed more fuel
than they consume, were developed here.
Also, internationally renowned for its
materials testing reactors and reactor
programs, this laboratory has become a
major research center for developing
peaceful uses of atomic energy.
