Twenty-two prospectors from Pierce discovered the Elk City 
mines in May 1861, and a gold rush followed that summer. <br><br>
Through July, the houses were "nice and airy, being constructed 
of brush, " with bars for doors " to keep out the cayuse horses." 
Permanent log buildings were begun August 6, and within a 
month about 40 stores, saloons and cabins were ready for 
winter use. Most of the miners rushed off to other new 
bonanzas that fall, but Elk City still became one of the 
important Idaho gold camps.<br><br>
