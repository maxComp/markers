Idaho's fur trade began in the fall of I809
when David Thompson built a trading post
two-and-a-half miles southwest of here.<br><br>
Kullyspell House (Thompson spelled
"Kalispell" that way) was the earliest fur
trade post in the American Pacific Northwest.
A geographer and surveyor of rare
skill, Thompson explored and mapped vast
fur regions for the North West Company of
Montreal. Reaching south from present day
British Columbia, he added what now is
North Idaho to the Canadian fur empire. It
was David Thompson who discovered the
route this highway now follows.
