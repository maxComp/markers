More than two decades before the American Falls Dam was 
built, water power was generated in a series of plants at 
American Falls. <br><br>Starting with an island plant to
 serve Pocatello in 1902, this superlative site was used soon 
after as long transmission lines were developed. As new 
kinds of turbines and generators were invented, they were 
installed here. Rare examples of old technology still are
 preserved in these landmark plants.
