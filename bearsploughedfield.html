Long before miners and ranchers settled the Stanley Basin, 
bears dominated this area. <br><br>When Alexander Ross 
and his Hudson's Bay Co. trappers stopped here, September 20, 
1824, they "observed at some distance the appearance of a
 ploughed field and riding up towards it, found a large piece 
of ground more than four acres in extent, dug up and turned 
over. On getting to the spot, we observed no less than nine 
black and grizzly bears at work, rooting away" eating camas, 
onions and wild celery.
