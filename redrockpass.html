You are standing in the outlet of ancient Lake
Bonneville. <br><br>It was a vast prehistoric inland
sea, of which Salt Lake is a modem remnant.
Covering over 20,000 square miles when it
overflowed here about 14,500 years ago, its
winding shoreline would have stretched
from here to New Orleans if it were
straightened out. This pass was deepened
considerably when Lake Bonneville began to
flow into the Snake River. For a time, a
torrent several times larger than the Amazon
was discharged here. Finally, with a hotter,
drier climate that slowly emerged about
8,000 years ago, Lake Bonneville gradually
disappeared.
