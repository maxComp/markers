Diversion Dam was completed in 1909 to
lift water into an already constructed New
York Canal system, greatly expanding its
irrigated farmlands.<br><br>
After a quarter-century of failing to dig a
large canal above Diversion Dam, United
States Reclamation Service funding
enabled a group of Boise Valley irrigation
districts to complete this project. Then in
1912, a generating plant was installed to
provide power to construct Arrowrock
Dam. It has been preserved as a historical
display by the Bureau of Reclamation.
