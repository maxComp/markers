While hunting for stolen horses on
August 20, 1878, William Monday, Jake
Groseclose, Tom Healy and "Three
Finger" Smith were ambushed by Indians
in a rocky basin about a mile from here.<br><br>
Monday and Groseclose were killed
immediately and Healy wounded; Smith,
"being a man of experience in such
matters," fled. He made it 40 miles to
Salmon Meadows. Infantrymen buried the
three, marked the spot and took up the
Indian trail. Smith estimated there were
75 Indians; Army trackers finally
concluded there were only five - but
they never caught them.  <br><br>
