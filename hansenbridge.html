Until 1919, when a high suspension bridge was completed 
here, this 16-mile long river gorge could only be crossed in a 
rowboat. <br><br>With 14 cables, each more than 900 feet 
long, a $100,000 suspension bridge was wide enough to 
accommodate two lanes of farm wagons or early cars that had 
begun to gain popularity then. From its deck, nearly 400 feet 
above the Snake River, travelers had a spectacular view that 
can still be seen from its replacement, built in 1966.
