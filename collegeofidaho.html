Planned by the Presbyterians of southern
Idaho in 1884 and opened with 19
students in 1891, this is Idaho's oldest
college.<br><br>
William Judson Boone, the founder,
remained president for 45 years. From a
modest beginning with a faculty of eight
(including two later governors and a chief
justice) , it grew to full college status and
moved in 1910 to this site, then an alkali
desert. A Boise Valley electric railroad
served the college, and an interurban
station, always known as the "Hat," still
stands on the campus as a reminder of the
college's pioneer days.<br><br>
