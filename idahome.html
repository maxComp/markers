After wheat crops flourished in this dry
farm area, Idahome sprang up here in
1916 as a railroad terminal. <br><br>Irrigation
projects boosted its economy.
When wheat farms disappeared and
highway traffic replaced rail service here,
Idahome became a ghost town. Its grain
elevators, lumber yards, stores, airport, oil
company, school, newspaper and people
are only past memories. An elevator and a
few building foundations mark its site.
