Constructed in 1924, this $1.5 million concrete gravity dam 
has a  1,039-foot crest and a 183-foot structural height. <br><br>
A 29-mile-long canal, along with lesser ditches, serves 58,250 
acres of Boise and Payette valley farms. A power plant at 
Black Canyon Dam generates electricity for commercial use 
as well as for irrigation pumping. Farms far from early 
riverside canals benefit from this project.
