When the Challis National Forest was established in 1908, this 
site became an administrative center. An early log ranger 
station stood here from 1909 to 1934. <br><br>Expanding 
Forest Service responsibilities led to construction of a larger 
ranger station, as well as other buildings still preserved here. 
When a new ranger station four miles south of here replaced 
this one in 1971, this site became a Sawtooth Interpretive and 
Historical Association Museum.
