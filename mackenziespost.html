Early in September 1812, Donald
Mackenzie set up a fur trade post near here
for John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company.<br><br>
Disappointed to find that beaver were
unavailable in this area, he built only a store
and two houses out of driftwood. Then, the
War of 1812 and Indian trouble tangled his
plans. In May 1813, he abandoned this site,
since Astor's venture had failed and was
about to be sold to the North West Company
of Montreal. "Perpetual Motion"
Mackenzie who once had been a
"Nor'Wester," rejoined the Canadians in
1816 and finally organized the snake
country fur trade.
