In 1868, Gilman Sawtell started a dude
ranch and Henrys Lake fishery that did
much to develop this natural resort area.
<br><br>
Sawtell did everything from supplying
swans for New York's Central Park zoo to
building a network of roads for tourist
access to Yellowstone National Park. His
commercial fishery served Montana
mining markets. His pioneer Henrys Lake
ranch was a major attraction here for a
decade before rail service brought more
settlers to this area.
