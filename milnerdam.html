When completed in 1904, Milner Dam
raised the Snake River 38 feet to divert
water into major north and south canals.<br><br>
A gravity system unmatched in size in
national reclamation development, this
project irrigates 360,000 acres of land.
Twin Falls, Jerome and a half-dozen other
communities suddenly sprang up in a
desert plain watered by 160 miles of main
canals. Located on lava channels formed
by two rock islands, Milner Dam's three
segments ( 462, 404 and 280 feet in
length) were built by four locally powered
electric cranes that were an engineering
marvel of that time.
