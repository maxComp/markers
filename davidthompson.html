Coming from Canada, the famous map
maker and trader for the Northwest
Company explored this area and river in
1808.<br><br>
On May 8 somewhere near here,
Thompson's famished party, all sick from
eating "much tainted" antelope, met 10
lodges of Indians who could give them
only a "few dried carp (of last year's
catch!) and some moss bread .. . but
acceptable to the hungry." Leaving here,
he found the route which U.S. 95 follows
north. Next year, he returned to establish
Idaho's initial fur trading post on Lake
Pend Oreille.
