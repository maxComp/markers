Long before white men discovered this
river, Indians used to camp here at this
important early crossing.<br><br>
Fur traders, surveyors and miners
followed the old Indian trail that forded
the river here at Seneacquoteen - a
Kalispell word meaning "crossing."
During the Kootenay gold rush of 1864, a
wagon road came from Walla Walla to a
ferry here. The Wild Horse Trail - a pack
route - ran on north to the Kootenay
mines in British Columbia.
