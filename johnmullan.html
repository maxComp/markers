John Mullan was the Army officer who in 1859-62 surveyed 
and built the Mullan Road from Walla Walla, Washington, to 
Fort Benton, Montana. <br><br>The road was to connect 
the Missouri and the Columbia rivers. Congress approved it 
in 1855. Indian troubles and lack of funds delayed the job,
 but the road was completed in 1862. The first route in 
1859 had passed about six miles west of here, but floods
 forced a change, and the final road passed north of 
Coeur d'Alene Lake. Interstate 90 follows Mullan's final route.
