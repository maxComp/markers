Numerous wooden buildings fronted Copperfield's main and side streets.
These were eleven saloons (most with whorehouses behind them),
gambling halls, a post office-meat market, two boarding houses, a livery
barn, barber shop, several stores a couple of hotels and eventually a 
railroad depot.  The four-cell jail had an outside stairway to a second floor
meeting room.
<br><br>
The school teacher and fifty other residents sent the governor of Oregon
a complaint about the town's gamblers, thugs, drunks and prostitutes.
<br><br> 
The governor was a man dedicated to temperance, so he decided to act.
The mayor and city council were arrested.  Twenty-seven indictments
were returned  against the defendants.  Fires in 1915 and 1935 destroyed
the major buildings.  Thus ended the town known as "Gomorrah on the Snake".
