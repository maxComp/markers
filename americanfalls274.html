The town is named for the nearby falls of
the Snake River, a famous landmark for
fur trappers and early Western travelers.<br><br>
The Oregon Trail passed close to the falls,
which had been named in contrast to
Canadian Falls - now known as
Shoshone Falls - 95 miles downstream.
The town of American Falls was founded
when the railroad came in 1882 and
served a ranching area. An important
power dam was built in 1902. When the
present large irrigation dam was built in
1925-27, the town had to be moved out of
the reservoir area.<br><br>
