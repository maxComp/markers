<br><br>
Without a doubt this byway has the most diverse stretch of road 
in Idaho. You will experience wetlands, the vistas of the high 
mountain desert, expansive lava flows, and the Lost River Mountain 
Range boasting nine of Idaho's twelve highest peaks including the 
highest peak, Mt. Borah.
<br><br>
The byway features world-dass fly fishing on beautiful Silver Creek, 
a unique rock formation known to the locals as the "Queens Crown" 
and the Carey Lake Wildlife Management area home to dozens of 
species of birds and waterfowl. There is Idaho's first national 
monument, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve 
with thousands of acres of lava fields and unique rock formations. 
In Arco, the "First City in the World to be Lit by Atomic Energy," 
you can see a submarine in the desert.
<br><br>
In the magnificent Lost River Valley, there are peaceful miles of 
agricultural lands in the shadow of the Lost River Mountain Range. 
The valley narrows and mountains seem to increase in size as you 
near Mt. Borah and the rest of the "great peaks." At Spar Canyon 
you may see wild horses roaming the desert and are reminded of 
old western movies as you wind through Grandview Canyon.
