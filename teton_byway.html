The jagged spine of the Teton Range is actually in Wyoming and 
visitors enjoy access to the peaks from the quiet side" on the western 
slopes, along the Teton Scenic Byway. At nearly 10 million years 
young, the Tetons are the newest mountains in the Rockies. In fact, 
they continue to grow today at the snaillike pace of about an inch 
every hundred years. In fact, the largest peak on the range, Grand 
Teton, now stands at 13,772 feet.<br><br>
Beginning at Swan Valley, this byway travels east on Idaho 31 
through the beautiful Pine Creek pass to the town of Victor, and 
then north on Idaho 33, along the western side of the Teton Range. 
The mountains sharply contrast with the rolling agricultural fields to 
the north and west. In the towns of the Teton Valley, Victor, 
Driggs, and Tetonia, travelers can enjoy small town hospitality, 
internationally famous resorts and festival events held throughout 
the year. <br><br>
West of Tetonia, the byway turns north on Idaho 32, offering 
glimpses of the Tetons and the Falls River until it reaches Ashton, 
where the Mesa Falls Scenic Byway begins.
