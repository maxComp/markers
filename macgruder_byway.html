In October 1863 Lloyd Magruder left Lewiston to sell supplies to miners
in Alder Gulch.  A friend noticed a gang of men leave Lewiston minutes
later and he was apprehensive about their intentions.<br><br>
Magruder sold his his goods to the miners and cleared $25,000.  The 
gang of men ambushed Magruder and killed him and his men and then 
headed back to Lewiston. Magruder's friend again noticed the gang and
went looking for evidence.  He found Macgruder's horse and got a warrant
for the arrest of the gang. In a harrowing chase from Lewiston to Portland
and on to San Francisco he obtained custody of the gang and brought them 
back to Lewiston for trial.  The grand jury returned indictments in 
January, 1864 and the gang was hung in March.
