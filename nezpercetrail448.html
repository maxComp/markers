Following high ridges, buffalo hunters cut
an old Indian trail along a direct route
from Lewiston past here to Lemhi Valley.<br><br>
This trail was not available to Lewis and
Clark in 1805, but an early missionary Samuel
Parker crossed it with a Nez
Perce trading party 30 years later. During
an 1862 Montana gold rush, eager miners
joined Lewiston merchants who sent pack
trains over it with supplies for new gold
camps. But bandits and robbers made
wilderness travel unsafe along it.
