This traditional Indian route provided
access from Montana's buffalo country to
Snake and Salmon river fishing streams.<br><br>
Hudson's Bay Co. trapping expeditions
came this way after 1822, and prospectors
followed, searching for mines. Then in
1877, Nez Perce war combatants returned
from Montana to Idaho through Bannock
Pass on their way from Big Hole battleground
to Yellowstone Park and Canada.
From 1910 to 1939, railroad trains from
Dillon to Salmon steamed through here.
Old Gilmore and Pittsburgh railroad
tunnels and grades still can be seen from
this highway.
