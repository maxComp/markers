The Lewis and Clark party crossed this pass September 13, 
1805, westbound for the Pacific after a long detour from the 
south. From the headwaters of the Missouri, they had crossed 
the mountains to the Salmon. <br><br>Finding that river 
impassable, they traded for packhorses, hired an Indian 
guide and came north to an Indian trail across the mountains 
here. Tired and ill-fed, the men had a hard struggle in early 
snow along the steep ridges which the trail followed for most 
of its 125-mile course west to the Clearwater River.
