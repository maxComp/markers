<p>
On their way north searching for a route
over Idaho's mountain barrier, Lewis and
Clark left this canyon and ascended a
high ridge to reach the Bitterroot Valley in
early September, 1805.<br><br>
No Indian trail came this way, but Tobe,
their experienced Shoshoni guide, got
them past the ridge anyway. They had to
follow a difficult ridge top divide over
peaks more than 1,000 feet higher than
this highway. They met some Flathead
Indians who surprised them by speaking a
language stranger than anything they had
ever heard.
