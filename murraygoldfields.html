<p>
After prospecting north of here from 1878
to 1882, A.J. Prichard showed a few
fortune hunters where to find gold. <br><br>More
than a year later, a horde of miners rushed
there to start Eagle City.
A permanent camp followed at Murray,
January 22, 1884. As Shoshone County
seat (1885-98) and this area's gold center,
Murray flourished for more than a decade.
Important buildings - a courthouse,
Masonic Hall and other landmarks -
have been preserved there to reflect life in
a gold rush camp a century ago.
