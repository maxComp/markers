Molten rock, forced upward for 30 to 50
miles through fissures in the earth, has
cooled into hard lava found here.<br><br>
Continued pressure from below has made
great cracks in the contorted surface. This
lava solidified only a few thousand years
ago, and not very much soil covers it yet.
But vegetation is getting a start and unless
new flows intervene, windblown soils will
cover these rock layers. The surface here
will then look the same as the surrounding 
plains, which also are layers of lava
and windblown soils.
