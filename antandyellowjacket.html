According to a Nez Perce Indian legend, the stone arch up 
the hill was once two fighting insects. <br><br>Ant and 
Yellowjacket had an argument and came to blows over who 
had the right to eat dried salmon here. Fighting fiercely, 
they failed to notice Coyote, the all-powerful animal spirit. 
Even when he ordered them to stop, they kept on struggling. 
For not heeding his warning, he turned them to stone while 
their backs were arched and their jaws locked together in 
combat.
