 A guide to the history of Idaho from a geographical context, this 
volume follows the roadways of Idaho and tells about interesting 
history that happened in the area. <br><br>This is not a travel 
guide in the usual sense--but a boon for history buffs. While 
campgrounds, hikes, and other attractions are mentioned in passing, 
the emphasis is on history and sometimes geology of each route 
covered. It's as interesting an armchair read as it is a companion 
for the road. <br><br>704 pages
