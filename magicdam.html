<p>
Completed in 1910 at a cost of $3 million, Magic Dam stores 
water for 89,000 acres of irrigated farms near Shoshone and 
Richfield. <br><br>Rising 129 feet high, it is 700 feet wide. 
An adjacent 1,600-foot embankment with a concrete spillway 
helps retain more than 190,000 acre-feet of spring floodwater 
for summer use downstream. A four-mile desert road reaches 
Magic Dam, which provides fishing and recreational 
opportunities in a broad valley northwest of here.
