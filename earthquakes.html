On October 28, 1983, a major earthquake
fracture, 26 miles long and seven miles
deep, surfaced as the Lost River Valley slid
away from Mount Borah.<br><br>
During that rock shift, Mount Borah's
ridge front rose about six inches, while
this valley subsided nine feet. This kind of
movement has been going on here for 10
to 20 million years as subsurface rock has
been pulled apart during gradual but
persistent range and valley building. You
can drive to a spectacular fracture that
shattered this side road 2.5 miles from
here.
