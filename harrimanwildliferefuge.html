Henry's Fork meanders through a 16,000-
acre wildlife refuge that retains diverse
habitats for many kinds of birds and
animals.<br><br>
Lodgepole pine forests and open meadows
provide many opportunities to enjoy
wildlife here, and fly fishing still is
allowed in this region of scenic beauty.
Moose, deer and elk find plenty of food
and shelter, while eagles, hawks and owls
thrive in open hunting grounds. Access is
through Harriman State Park.
