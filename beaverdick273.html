This park is named for "Beaver Dick," a
mountain man of late fur trade days who
lived in this locality until 1899.<br><br>
He was born in England, and his real
name was Richard Leigh. He came west as
a trapper, but the real fur trade was
already over. So he married a Shoshoni
woman and stayed hereabouts. A popular
early outfitter and guide, he served the
famous Hayden surveying party in 1872.
Leigh Lake in Grand Teton National Park
is named for him, and Jenny Lake for his
first wife. A picturesque character, he was
widely known and liked.
