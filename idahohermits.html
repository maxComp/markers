Living for more than 60 years in hand-built "dugouts" 
across the Salmon River from this site, Richard "Dugout
 Dick" Zimmerman (1916-2010) came to symbolize the 
Idaho hermit.<br><br>

With colorful names like Buckskin Bill and Hank 
the Hermit, these men (and a few women) eked out 
lonely existences, many along the Salmon River. 
Dugout Dick built multiple dugout caves during 
his time on the Salmon and eventually died here 
at age 94. By the 1980s, Dick's dugouts had become 
a local landmark, easily visible across the Salmon 
River. After Dicks death, the BLM reclaimed the 
dugouts, citing safety concerns. A cabin built by 
Dick remains on the site, which includes interpretive 
signs. The site can be accessed by crossing the one-lane
 bridge a short drive north of here by following the 
directional signage.
