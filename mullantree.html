At the summit, 3.4 miles west, a side road
leads to the tree carved by road builders
during a Fourth of July celebration in
1861.<br><br>
The famous Mullan Road, connecting Fort
Benton on the Missouri with Fort Walla
Walla on the Columbia, originally ran
south of Coeur d'Alene Lake. But to avoid
bad conditions there, Army Captain John
Mullan in 1861 built 30 miles of new road
- which this highway still follows quite
closely. His crew celebrated July Fourth at
the summit, chopping the date into a great
white pine that was partially destroyed by a
storm in late 1962.
