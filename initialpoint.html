All Idaho land surveys refer to a beginning
point - "Initial Point" - 16 miles
directly south of here.<br><br>
When he began surveying Idaho in 1867,
Lafayette Cartee, first surveyor general of
Idaho Territory, established the initial
point on a volcanic hill visible for many
miles. Everywhere in Idaho , surveyors
depend upon this essential point in
establishing land boundaries. The city of
Meridian is named for the Boise Meridian
- the surveyors' north-south line that
runs through Initial Point.
