An emigrant from Denmark, where he
had studied forestry; Grandjean came to
this part of Idaho in 1883 to mine, hunt
and trap.<br><br>
Before Idaho became a state in 1890, he
built a winter cabin below Grandjean
Peak at a site later occupied by the
Grandjean ranger station. Because of his
European studies, he became a professional
forester here. He served as supervisor
of the Boise National Forest from
1906-22.
