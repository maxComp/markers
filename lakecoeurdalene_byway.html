The Lake Coeur d'Alene (cor-da-lane) Scenic Byway travels an 
area where the lakes, mountains, and beautiful summer weather 
have made it one of the most famous summer playgrounds and 
resort destinations in the Pacific Northwest. It's also home to a 
variety of wildlife, including moose, deer, elk, bear and several 
bird species, still roaming the pristine forests of northern Idaho.
<br><br>
Beginning at the junction of Interstate 90 and Idaho 97, the route 
travels south along the eastern shoreline of Lake Coeur d'Alene, 
home to bald eagles and the largest population of nesting osprey in 
the Western states. Take a break and stretch your legs on the 
Mineral Ridge Trail, which offers panoramic views of the lake, as 
well as several learning stations describing the area's botany and 
animal life.
<br><br>
The route continues through gentle hills and dense forests to the 
charming town of Harrison. This byway ends at Idaho 3, where it 
meets the White Pine Scenic Byway and its southern route to the 
Palouse.
