This pioneer Idaho town was founded
September 26, 1863, when a wagon train
brought more than 30 families of Mormon
colonizers.<br><br>
More pioneers soon followed, some living
in huts of quaking aspen and others
building log cabins for the mild first
winter. Next spring, 700 more people
arrived in the valley. The second winter
was terrible, but the settlers persevered.
They thought they were in Utah until an
1872 boundary survey showed this was
part of Idaho. When Bear Lake County
was created in 1875, Paris became the
county seat.<br><br>
