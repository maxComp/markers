Bear Lake straddles the Idaho-Utah border and boasts sandy beaches, 
great water sports, fishing, boating and the famous Bear Lake State 
Park. This byway follows Bear Lake north on U.S. 89 to Montpelier, 
then north on U.S. 30, where you leave the Cache National Forest 
and enter the Caribou National Forest. 
<br><br>
The intersection of U.S. 89 
and U.S. 30 at Montpelier is the site of the attractive National 
Oregon-California Trail Center dedicated to the history and scenic 
wonders of the 2,000-mile Oregon-California Trail. There, you 
can ride in computer-controlled covered wagons, journey nearby 
trails with experienced guides in period costume, and handle the 
tools and other artifacts used by the pioneers. There is also an 
expansive park and playground to stretch your legs, as well as a 
general store and gift shop to help you remember your visit. 
<br><br>
There are 13 Oregon-California Trail sites identified in
 the Soda Springs area. These sites are documented in diaries of 
the emigrants, in military records, by early mountain men, and 
settlers. "Travel the Oregon Trail in Caribou County" brochure 
contains information and directions on each site. The Mormon 
ghost town of Chesterfield lies 25 miles northwest of Soda Springs 
and is located right on the Oregon-California Trail.
