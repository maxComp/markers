On June 1, 1871, Frederick Post made a
deal with Seltice - a prominent Coeur
d'Alene Indian leader - to obtain more
than 200 acres of land to start a mill near
here.<br><br>
Post noted his land cession on this
prominent rock, incising his name and
treaty date above some old Indian rock art
that still can be seen there. He operated
his sawmill for many years at a major
hydroelectric site now used for a large
power plant.
