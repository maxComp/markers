Rising to an elevation of more than 6,800 feet, Cariboo Mountain
 - visible north of here - has two of Idaho's highest gold camps. <br><br>
Jesse "Cariboo Jack" Fairchild discovered gold high on Cariboo Mountain in 
August 1870, and a mining rush from Utah followed in 
September. Production continued for two decades before 
the gold ran out, with millions of dollars worth of gravels 
yielding mineral values during that long period of successful 
mining. But Cariboo Jack was killed by a bear there in 1884.
