Two cones of glassy lava are located directly south of here. 
The largest rises 800 feet above the surrounding plain. <br><br>
Hot molten lava, erupting from great depth, met cold surface 
water in the wet flood plain of the Snake River. The northern 
butte, in fact, formed in the channel of the Henrys Fork, which 
was forced further east. Suddenly chilled into small particles 
of volcanic glass, the lava exploded in a great spray of steam 
and solid fragments that built up into wind-blown cones around 
large summit craters a half-mile long and 200 to 400 feet deep.
