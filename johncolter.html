John Colter discovered this valley in 1808 while exploring the 
Yellowstone and upper Snake country in search of beaver. <br><br>
Setting out by himself with his gun and a 30-pound pack, he 
tried to get the Indians to join in his trapping business. On 
the way here from a Yellowstone post 240 miles to the 
northeast, he came upon Colter's Hell - some hot springs near 
Cody, Wyoming. On his way back, he explored Yellowstone 
Park. In the spring of 1810, after several perilous escapes 
from the Blackfeet, he returned to Missouri, lucky to get 
back alive.
