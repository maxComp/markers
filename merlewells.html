Dr. Merle Wells<br>1918-2000<br><br>
State historian emeritus Dr. Merle Wells
has been instrumental in the development
and continuing progress of the highway
historical marker program.<br><br>
Dr. Wells has identified and written the
majority of the texts for the signs and has
been involved with the program since its
inception in 1956. <br><br>His efforts have made
Idaho's historical marker program one of
the finest in the nation.
The depth and breadth of Wells' impact
on the state's historical markers is reflected in a Utah historian's journal entry
as he traced the route of fur trader
Alexander Ross:
"I was sure I was onto something nobody
else had ever figured out, and then, as I
rounded a bend on the road to Galena
Summit, here was this big historical sign
with the headline, 'ALEXANDER ROSS.'
Merle Wells had been there before me,
and for the rest of the summer I kept
running into more of his signs. "
<br><br>
Wells wrote the legislation creating
the state archives. He was head of the
National Register of Historic Places
program in Idaho and has worked for
the Idaho State Historical Society,
both officially and as an unpaid
volunteer, for nearly 50 years. .<br><br>He has
taught in six college departments and
written over 113 articles and 15
books about the state or region.
Arthur Hart, director emeritus of the
Idaho State Historical Society,
likened Wells to a walking encyclopedia.
"For anybody who studies or writes about
Idaho history, Merle Wells is the final
authority," said Hart..<br><br>
Since Wells' official retirement in 1986, he
has continued writing historical books
and conducting research and consultation
at the state archives he helped create.
At Wells' retirement, David Stratton,
professor emeritus at Washington State
University said, "Wells has accumulated a
precious store of closely integrated
information, as if he had been there when
... the territorial government of Idaho was
established. ".<br><br>
Wells continues to add to a lasting
historical legacy and has left an indelible
mark on the historic marker program. As
future generations travel Idaho highways,
they'll learn about Idaho's past thanks to a
great teacher, Merle Wells.
