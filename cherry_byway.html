Once gold miners passed through the area in the 1860s, it wasn't
long before several bold entrepreneurs settled in the fertile land 
along the Payette River and established a small community that 
eventually became known as the town of Emmett. <br><br>
With plenty of water available from the Payette River, some of 
these early settlers planted gardens and fruit trees and helped supply 
food to the mining camps in the mountains. By the time an elaborate
canal system had been developed, and with the completion of Black 
Canyon Dam above the town in 1924, hundreds of orchards had been
 planted in what became known as the Valley of Plenty.<br><br>
Apples, peaches, apricots, pears, prunes and plums were available for 
market, and by 1940 Emmett had become the largest shipping point 
in Idaho for sweet cherries. With abundant harvests of all that fruit, 
it stands to reason that early residents would choose to celebrate 
their good fortune, and so in 1928 the tradition of the Cherry Festival 
was born.
