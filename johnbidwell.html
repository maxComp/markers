In 1840, John Bidwell began to assemble
emigrants from Missouri to open a road
to California, and a year later he set out
with a party of 69 Pacific Coast pioneers.<br><br>
When they reached here, August 12,
1841, half of his group decided to go
northwest to Oregon instead. His California crew turned south down the Bear
River to try a terrible route west of Salt
Lake. So, Joseph R. Chiles returned east
in 1849 to find a practical California Trail
across Idaho through Fort Hall and
Granite Pass.
