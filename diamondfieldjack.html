J.L. Davis - Diamondfield Jack - spent most of six years in 
the Cassia County Jail while the courts and pardon board 
were trying to figure out what to do with him. <br><br>By
 far the best known of the gunmen who fought in Idaho's 
sheep and cattle wars, he was tried here for shooting two 
sheep-herders in 1896. After he was convicted, other 
cattlemen confessed to the crime. Twice he narrowly escaped 
hanging, before the pardon board turned him loose late in 
1902 after deciding he wasn't guilty after all.
