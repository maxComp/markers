A French Canadian who came to southern
Idaho in 1818, Joseph Cote found this
valley while trapping beaver.<br><br>
Though he was miles from his Canadian
base in Montreal, he had years of
experience in Pacific Northwest
exploration. With Michel Bourdon, who
also discovered valleys near here, he had
joined David Thompson's 1811 Columbia
River explorers. Early trappers knew this
valley as Cote's Defile because of his
contribution to the regional fur trade.
