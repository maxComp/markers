<p>
Lack of a good transportation system
delayed serious lead and silver mining at
Gilmore from 1880 to 1910.<br><br>
Construction of a branch railroad from
Montana to serve this mining area
resulted in the production of $11.5
million worth of ore before a power plant
explosion halted operations here in 1929.
Old Gilmore and Pittsburgh Railway
grades visible north of here and remnants
of Gilmore - a ghost town abandoned
many years ago a mile west of here -
preserve visible evidence of that bygone
mining era.
