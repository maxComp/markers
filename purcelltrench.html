A long, glaciated valley, extending from British Columbia this 
far into Idaho, brought part of a continental ice sheet past 
here thousands of years ago. <br><br>Rocks and boulders 
transported here by glacial ice backed up Lake Coeur d'Alene. 
Then a gradually warming climate let an outlet from Lake 
Pend Oreille discharge past here - sometimes with catastrophic 
results. As ice receded, the Kootenai River also flowed past 
here before lower channels in British Columbia no longer were 
blocked by a glacial barrier. In those days, this was the Columbia
 River's main channel.
