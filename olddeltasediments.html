Diverted into this valley by lava flows, the Bear River 
deposited 
a huge, mostly red clay delta here where it entered a vast
inland 
sea that covered much of Utah. <br><br>About 14,500 years 
ago, its shoreline suddenly went down about 80 feet following 
an enormous discharge into the Snake River. From then on, 
it gradually receded to become the Salt Lake. Bear River then
 had to cut through and erode its old delta, forming the steep 
sides and gullies you see here today.
