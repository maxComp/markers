After crossing Lemhi Pass, 12 miles east
of here, Meriwether Lewis unfurled the
American flag for the first time west of the
Rockies.<br><br>
Lewis met with three Shoshoni Indians
near here on August 13, 1805. " ... Leaving
my pack and rifle I took the flag which I
unfurled and advanced toward them,"
Lewis reported. The Warm Springs Road
leads to a marker at the site, about eight
miles from here.
