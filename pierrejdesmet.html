Roman Catholic missionary services
began in Idaho on Sunday, July 10, 1840,
in Teton Valley, followed by a Mass held
near here at Henry's Lake, July 23.<br><br>
Pierre J. DeSmet, a Belgian Jesuit leader,
accompanied a Pend d'Oreille-Flathead
band on their way northwest to their
homeland. Climbing a mountain here,
along streams "descending from dizzy
heights, leaping from rock to rock with a
deafening noise, " he invoked divine
thanks for his successful tour into Idaho
and Montana.
