Lewiston's first bridge across the Clearwater River
was constructed in 1913 and replaced in 1951.
<br><br>
Early efforts for a bridge were opposed by ferryboat owners, but
 other business leaders recognized the need for a link to northern 
communities. Spanning 780 feet, its steel girders and railings were 
painted green and red. The wooden deck was 19 feet wide to 
accommodate large wagons. Automobiles and heavy trucks soon 
challenged the design.
