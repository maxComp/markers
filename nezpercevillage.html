This important archaeological site was
occupied for 10,000 years or more and
has at least 10 pit houses as much as
5,000 years old.<br><br>
Two styles of houses were used. Some
were fairly square with interior benches
dug out for use by a family or two. Others
were round - 20 to 30 feet wide and two
to three feet deep - but lacked benches.
This village reached its height from about
4,100 to 2,600 years ago, but remained
important enough that when fur traders
arrived in 1812, they made this their main
camp.
