Early California and Oregon trail ruts, left
by thousands of emigrant wagons as they
ascended this bluff, are still visible below
this viewpoint.<br><br>
In 1859, F.W. Lander's wagon road
builders dug an improved grade that
shows more clearly. California traffic, for
which Lander constructed a better road,
diverged from this Snake River route to
Oregon just beyond Raft River, six miles
west of here. When they got up this
grade, emigrants were thankful that they
had passed 20 miles of bad road and that
a less demanding trail lay ahead.
