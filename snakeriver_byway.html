The Snake River Canyon Scenic Byway is a rich tapestry of places, 
people, and scenic lands that encompasses all that is truly Idaho. 
Dating back nearly 4.5 million years, the rich agricultural land found
 today along the byway was born of fire when volcanoes dominated 
the land. Nearly 15,000 years ago water reshaped the land as the 
Bonneville Flood, one of the largest floods in geologic history, 
flooded the entire valley.
Over the milleniums, nature continued to define the land, creating 
a unique ecosystem of wildlife and plants that are found only in 
southwestern Idaho. <br><br>The Snake River Canyon Scenic 
Byway spans more than fifty miles. To drive the byway is to share 
the same visual experience the early pioneers observed when they
 arrived to create a new life in the sagebrush-covered valley. Today's 
rich agricultural lands and the vibrant cities found along the byway
 are the legacy passed down to us by those early Idaho pioneers - a 
living legacy for all of us to discover, enjoy, and to offer to our 
children as we drive a truly southwestern Idaho roadway.
