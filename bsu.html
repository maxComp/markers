Expanding from a two-year community
college (1932-1965) to a campus with a
graduate program, Boise State was
designated as a university in 1974.<br><br>
Originating as an Episcopalian academy
founded in 1892, this institution was
located a mile north until 1940, when
Boise's municipal airport, located here,
became available for a large new campus.
Christ's Chapel, Boise's original
Episcopalian church building which was
built downtown in 1886, was moved to
this site for permanent preservation in
1963.<br><br>
