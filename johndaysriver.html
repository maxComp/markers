Fur traders named this stream for John Day, a pioneer 
trapper who died 12 miles north of here, February 16, 1820. <br><br>
John Day had started west with John Jacob Astor's Pacific 
Fur Company party that discovered the Snake River Valley
 to the south of here in 1811. After 1816, he joined Donald 
Mackenzie's band of fur hunters, who finally spent the winter 
of 1819-20 in what now is known as Little Lost River Valley. 
For many years, trappers and mapmakers referred to 
Mackenzie's Fallert Springs campground as John Day's 
Defile, a major fur trade landmark.
