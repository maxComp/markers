When General O.O. Howard tried to get
more than 600 Nez Perce Indians to settle
on a North Idaho reservation in 1877, he
ran into a lot of trouble here.<br><br>
On their way to Yellowstone Park, Chief
Joseph's Nez Perce people reached Hole in
the Rock Station (four miles north of
here) on August 16, and shut down stage
service to Montana. Howard's cavalry and
volunteers followed only a day behind
until August 20, when an Indian force
made off with more than 100 Army
mules. That raid halted military pursuit
and forced Howard to continue his Nez
Perce campaign for six more weeks.
