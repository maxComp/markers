Rich in scenery, history, and wildlife, the route along Idaho 11 begins 
in Greer at the junction of U.S. 12 with an easy climb up the Greer 
Grade, providing a breathtaking panoramic view of the Clearwater 
Valley At the crest of the mountain lie the beautiful rolling fields of 
grains and grasses cultivated by local farmers, Just down the road is 
the historic town of Weippe, not far from where members of the Nez 
Perce Tribe met and fed starving members of Lewis and Clark's Corps 
of Discovery in 1805.
<br><br>
Minutes later, the scenery changes again, as the vast fields transform 
into a lush forest thick with wildlife. Nestled among the trees is the 
town of Pierce, where early pioneers discovered gold in Idaho for the 
first time. It also boasts the state's inaugural government building, 
the old Shoshone County Courthouse. Other attractions include a 
logging museum, the city library's artifact collection from the 
adventures of Chinese miners in the area, and five more historical 
sites featured along the byway.
<br><br>
Twelve miles north of Pierce is the village of Headquarters, marking 
the end of the Gold Rush Historic Byway and the beginning of the 
area's other "old mine" - the majestic and seemingly endless 
Clearwater National Forest.
