Long before white men discovered these
springs, September 9, 1812, Indians
gathered here to use the free hot water.<br><br>
Except where they found hot springs,
prehistoric Indians had a hard time
getting hot water. They wove water-tight
baskets into which they put heated rocks.
Here they had plenty of hot water for
baths and for processing hides without
going to all the work of heating baskets.
This was one of their major campgrounds,
especially in the winter. After 1868, when
they began to stay mostly on the Fort Hall
Indian Reservation, this spot lost its
importance as a winter camp.
