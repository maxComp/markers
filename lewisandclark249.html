On their way west in 1805, Lewis and Clark descended into 
Clearwater Canyon on an old Indian Trail across from here. <br><br>
After more than a month's search, they finally reached a 
westward river where they could use canoes. From here
 they continued another 16 miles with their packhorses before 
they found a campsite with trees suitable for making canoes. 
But at this point, they had finished their difficult mountain 
passage to navigable Columbia water.
