<p>
Sacajawea returned to her homeland in
this valley in 1805 as an interpreter for
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark
when they explored these mountains.<br><br>
When she was about 14 years old, she
had been captured by Indians in Montana,
where her people were out hunting
buffalo in 1800. Reunited with her family,
she helped Lewis and Clark obtain Indian
horses and a Shoshoni guide to show
them how to reach their Columbia River
destination.
