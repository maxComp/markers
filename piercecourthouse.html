<p>
Shoshone County's original courthouse -- and Idaho's 
earliest public building -- still stands in Pierce, where 
it was built in 1862.<br><br>
Although Pierce gained a large population for a year 
after gold was discovered here in 1860, most of the 
miners soon moved on to other camps. By 1880, 
Shoshone County had only 469 people left, of whom 
296 were Chinese. When a new gold rush 80 miles 
farther north led to removal of county government to 
Murray in 1885, Pierce courthouse became a private 
home. Eventually preserved by Mrs. Henry Spencer 
Lawson, it now is a component of Nez Perce National 
Historical Park.
