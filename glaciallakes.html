Moving from the north down this valley,
the edge of the continental ice sheet
blocked rivers and formed glacial lakes.
<br><br>
As the ice gradually melted, a lake rose
here behind the receding ice dam and
extended up Kootenai Valley into Canada.
Until the ice disappeared about 10,000
years ago, this lake drained through the
valley to the south. Then, the Kootenai
River cut down the lake bottom, exposing
the small tree-covered granite hill in the
valley before you. Lakes Coeur d' Alene
and Pend Oreille, to the south, are
remnants of this glacial action.
