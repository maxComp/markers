Founded as a mining town in 1884,
Wallace became a railroad center in 1887
and Shoshone County seat in 1889.<br><br>
Rebuilt after a disasterous fire in 1890,
Wallace has preserved its pioneer mining
heritage. North Idaho's two million-acre
forest fire was stopped here in 1910, and
business buildings of that era survive in
an impressive historic district. A museum
in Wallace's restored 1901 Northern
Pacific Depot, on Sixth Street, interprets
the region's railway history
