An old emigrant road headed west across
Camas Prairie and then descended to the
valley below on its way to rejoin the
Oregon Trail 20 miles southwest of here.<br><br>
This route, discovered by Donald
Mackenzie's fur trade party in 1820, came
into use for emigrant wagons in 1852.
Indian hostility along the regular Oregon
Trail to the south led Timothy Goodale to
bring a large emigrant party of Idaho
pioneers this way in 1862. After that, the
road was known as Goodale's Cutoff.
