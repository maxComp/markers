"A bluff jolly good fellow," he joined the
Rocky Mountain fur trade in 1829,
married a Nez Perce in 1838 and settled
with the Lapwai band in 1840.<br><br>
In 1850, the Oregon Donation Land Act
gave free farms to pioneers who had come
to the Oregon Territory. Craig had the
only eligible farm in Idaho (then part of
Oregon) and filed a 640-acre claim here.
When the Nez Perce reservation was set
up, the Indians trusted Craig and let him
keep his farm.
