<p>
Constructed in 1910 about eight miles
west of here, the Salmon Dam was a
spectacular early irrigation structure.<br><br>
Two hundred twenty feet high, it blocks a
narrow lava gorge of Salmon Falls Creek.
Intended to create a large reservoir to
irrigate desert lands north of here, it was
only a partial success. Porous lava canyon
walls let water escape around it and lack
of rainfall in Nevada's desert above here
provided less than enough moisture for
this reservoir. It did not fill up until 1984.
