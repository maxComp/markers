Coming west with Ezra Meeker in 1852,
Thomas McAuley decided to build a road
to let emigrants bypass Big Hill.<br><br>
Worst of all Oregon Trail descents, Big
Hill needed replacement. Eliza McAuley
reported that her brother Tom "fished
awhile, then took a ramble ... and
discovered a pass by which the mountain
can be avoided by doing a little road
building. " With an emigrant crew, he
opened a wagon toll road that followed
current Highway 30. After 1852, no one
maintained the new route and it fell into
disuse.
