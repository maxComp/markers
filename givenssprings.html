Natural hot water available here has been a popular attraction 
for thousands of years.<br><br> A winter village site for 
about 5,000 years, these hot springs had large pit houses 
typical of plateau communities northwest of here from 4,300 
to about 1,200 years ago. After that, small huts used by 
Great Basin tribes became fashionable. Deer, rabbits and 
river mussels sustained this Winter camp. After 1842, 
emigrants using an Oregon Trail alternate also patronized 
Givens Springs.
