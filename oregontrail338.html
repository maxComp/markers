You have just crossed a small canyon that
Oregon Trail emigrants regarded as their
most dangerous exposure to Indian hostility.<br><br>
After 1854, they had good reason to be
alarmed. Wagon traffic had ruined important
traditional Indian trails. Thousands of oxen,
horses, sheep and cattle had overgrazed a
broad zone along their trail, leading to Indian
resentment. Worse yet, a few emigrants had
shot enough Indians to provoke a great deal
of bitterness. On August 9, 1862, Pocatello's
Shoshoni band resisted further wagon traffic
here, trapping a small emigrant party in a
deep gully An unusually fine stretch of
wagon tracks leading to that site can be
reached by a marked trail from here.
