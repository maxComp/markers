Your phone cannot connect to GPS because <br>1. Location on your phone has been disabled or <br>2. You have no service from your provider,
<br><br>
In the first case go to settings on your phone, find Location and turn it on.
<br><br>
In the second case your provider doesn't have coverage in your location, so you need to wait until your coverage is accessible again.
