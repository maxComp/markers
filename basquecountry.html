<p>
Idaho has a large Basque community that
preserves its ancient European traditions
in a new land of opportunity.<br><br>
Coming here originally to herd sheep on
mountain and desert ranges, they shifted
into other occupations as quickly as
possible, making way for more of their
countrymen to follow. Their sheep
wagons often can be seen on grazing
lands, and a Basque museum (611 Grove
Street in Boise) interprets their life here.
