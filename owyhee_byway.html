The Owyhee Uplands Back Country Byway is one of those roads you 
want to drive in the summer, with a full gas tank and extra food and 
water. The eastern end of the byway is at Grand View, the western 
end at Jordan Valley, Oregon, about 103 miles away, not "as the crow 
flies" but as this gravel road makes its way around the southern end 
of the Owyhee Mountains. In between there are lots of sights, lots of 
wildlife and some good camping but not much else: deep river canyons,
 dry mountains, desert areas, small riparian zones, abandoned mining 
settlements... Most of the road is gravel and about 1.5 lanes wide at 
best. The route is usually impassable from late October through early 
May because of snow. Depending on how recent and how severe 
rainfall might be, the road can be impassable at almost any time of 
year. The best times to travel: early summer and fall.
<br><br>
The Owyhee Uplands are one of the last remaining large examples
 of a steppe-sagebrush ecosystem in North America. Some areas also
 sport juniper woodlands with some grizzled and twisted veterans up 
to 500 years old. As dry and barren as it might look to the casual 
observer, there are more than 180 species of birds and mammals that
 call the Uplands home.
<br><br>
Most of this countryside was formed and shaped by volcanic forces 
that began about 17 million years ago and ended about 2 million 
years ago. Since then, the countryside has been eroded into some 
great canyons, big mountains and a few odd shapes... This is also 
high desert: barren, dry and easily made impassable by a bit of 
moisture. But if you're willing to dare it, this is some gorgeous 
countryside that you just might have all to yourself.
<br><br>
Starting from Grand View on the Snake River, you're going to be 
driving BLM gravel road the whole way. About 8 miles south of 
Grand View you'll come to the abandoned Turmes Ranch. Settled in 
the 1880's Turmes Ranch was once upon a time a traveler's way 
station, back when this area was being scoured by gold and silver 
prospectors.
<br><br>
Beyond Turmes Ranch, you'll be heading up Shoofly Canyon and into 
the real Owyhee Uplands. This is a large area of desert with steep 
red-rock walls rising above streambeds cut deep into the ground. The
 steep, stark Owyhee Mountains rise to the north and in between are
 huge areas of scrub, sagebrush and wildflowers. A lot of folks think 
this area is what the West is supposed to look like and if you're one 
of those, you're in for a treat. Passing by some fantastical rock shapes
 and over deep canyons you'll eventually come to the (primitive) North
 Fork Campground on the North Fork of the Owyhee River. This is 
about 31 miles south of the end of the byway at Jordan Valley, OR.
<br><br>
From the campground, the route runs close to the rim of the North 
Fork Canyon and offers some incredible views of the Owyhee 
Mountains rising in the background above that canyon dropping 
below. Apparently, this area sees lots of photographers pulled over 
on the side of the road, doing their thing.
<br><br>
Jordan Valley has limited services available but you will find 
pavement there (US Highway 95), and if you go right (north), it's 
about 50 miles back to "civilization." The BLM says that normally, 
a typical passenger car will do fine along the road, just look out for
 inclement weather. You also want to be well-equipped with plenty 
of food, water, clothing, warm bedding, tent and maybe even an 
extra spare tire. Do not count on your cell phone to do anything 
other than its best impression of a paper weight in this countryside.
<br><br>
In the Owyhee Uplands, about 500,000 acres of the countryside has 
been set aside as designated Wilderness, with another 199,000 acres
 recently released from the category of "Wilderness Study Area." A 
large part of that land is along the deep canyons that the larger 
streams and rivers flow in but there are several upland areas along 
the Owyhee Uplands Back Country Byway that also carry the 
Wilderness designation. Along the route you'll find several trailheads 
just off the road that give access to places like Little Jacks Creek, 
Pole Creek and North Fork Owyhee Wildernesses.
