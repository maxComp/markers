After crossing the Continental Divide
southeast of here, August 12, 1805,
Meriwether Lewis camped with a
Shoshoni band near here August 13-14.<br><br>
Lewis had to obtain Indian horses so his
men could get from the upper Missouri to
a navigable stream flowing to the Pacific.
So he persuaded the Shoshoni to accompany
him to the expedition's main camp
east of the mountains. There he found the
Shoshoni chief to be Sacajawea's brother.
With horses and help from Sacajawea's
people, Lewis and William Clark came to
this valley August 26 on their way north
to the Lolo Trail and the Clearwater.
