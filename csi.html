In 1964, Twin Falls County voters
established a community college, and
Jerome County soon voted to join their
college district.<br><br>
Started in 1965 as part of a state and
national effort to expand local educational
opportunities, College of Southern Idaho
arts, science and vocational-technical
programs also provide related community
services for this area. In 1968, a modern
campus was occupied a mile west of here,
with a civic auditorium and a museum
facility incorporated into that site.<br><br>
