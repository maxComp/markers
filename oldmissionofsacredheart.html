<p>
Opened for services in 1853, this is the
oldest building in Idaho.<br><br>
Black-robed Jesuits founded the mission
in 1842, but moved here from their St. Joe
River site in 1846 and raised this imposing
building in a complete wilderness.
Old outbuildings are now gone, and their
mission moved to Desmet in 1877. But
this National Historic Landmark is
preserved as a state park
