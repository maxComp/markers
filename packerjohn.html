John Welch, always known as Packer
John, hauled supplies from Lewiston to
Idaho City during a major Boise Basin
gold rush of 1863-64.<br><br>
He built a cabin (one-quarter mile north
of here) that immediately became an
Idaho landmark. Territorial political
conventions (Republican in 1863 and
Democratic in 1864) used his cabin as a
point where north Idaho leaders could
meet with southern representatives to
choose congressional candidates. This site
was a state park and is now an Adams
County park.
