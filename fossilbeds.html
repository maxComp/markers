<p>
Fossil bones of zebras, beaver, otter,
pelicans and other water birds are found
in sediments left from a 3.4 million-year old pond on 
the bluff across the Snake
River.<br><br>
Lava flows, pouring out over the plains on
this side, met and dammed up sedimentary deposits 
washed in on the other side,
making lakes and swamps. Here the river
divides these two important geologic
settings, formed at a time when the
climate was wetter and the plains were
tree-dotted grasslands where zebra-like
horses used to graze.
