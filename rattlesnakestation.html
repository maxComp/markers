At the junction of the Rocky Bar road
with the Oregon Trail, this was a major
stage line stop for 20 years.<br><br>
Stage service commenced in 1864, and a
connection to the Rocky Bar mines was
moved here in 1870. In 1878, the station
owners thought it would sound a lot
better to call their place Mountain Home
instead of Rattlesnake. Then the Union
Pacific - built out in the valley in 1883
- replaced the freight wagons and stage
lines that came through here. So Mountain
 Home was moved on down Rattlesnake 
Creek to its present location on the railroad.
