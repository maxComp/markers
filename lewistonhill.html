<p>
When automobile traffic made a steep old
wagon road obsolete, a remarkable new
highway grade was built down this hill in
1917.<br><br>
With a series of sharp curves that let cars
go 20 or 30 miles an hour - a good speed
for that time - a gradual 10-mile, 2,000-foot grade was designed. It still can be
used by anyone not in too much of a
hurry who wants to see an engineering
model of early highway construction.
