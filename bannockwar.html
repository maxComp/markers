Angered by encroachment of white men
on Camas Prairie lands, which had been
guaranteed to the Bannock Indians by
treaty, Buffalo Horn's Band went to war
May 30, 1878.<br><br>
The war started in June on the Camas
Prairie and spread to central Oregon. The
Indians were returning to their reservation
at Fort Hall. Harried from the island, they
soon lost the pursuing troops in rough
country north of here. This was the last
real battle of the war.
