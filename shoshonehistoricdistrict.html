South-central Idaho's rail center since
1882 when trains reached here, Shoshone
has a historic district of unusual interest.<br><br>
Branch rail lines to the Wood River and
Camas Prairie served distant farmers and
miners, while a stage line to Shoshone
Falls accommodated wealthy tourists who
visited Idaho's foremost 19th-century
attraction. Vast sheep grazing lands made
this a major early center for Basque
herders. Use of lava rock for building
construction gives Shoshone a distinctive
historic character.
