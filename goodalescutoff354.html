When emigrants began to take their
westbound wagons along an old Indian
and trappers' trail past this lava, they had
to develop a wild and winding road.<br><br>
At this spot, like many others, they had
barely enough space to get by. At times
they could not avoid lava stretches. But
they slowly crept along, leaving their road
strewn with parts of broken wagons. J. C.
Merrill noted in 1864 that "at one place,
we were obliged to drive over a huge rock
just a little wider than the wagon. Had we
gone a foot to the right or to the left the
wagon would have rolled over."
