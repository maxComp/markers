An exceptionally large hydraulic pit, left by massive placer 
mining in this area, still can be seen one mile from here. <br><br>
Buffalo Company miners using hydraulic giants - large metal 
hoses with nozzles that could direct a stream of water under 
high pressure -  cut away a large hillside deposit of placer 
gold. Long ditches and flumes were employed to bring water 
in at an elevation sufficient to gain pressure enough to operate 
their giants.
