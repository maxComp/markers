To drive the Western Heritage Historic Byway is to experience "Wild"
 Idaho. The Birds of Prey National Conservation Area is home to the 
largest population of nesting raptors in the world. 
<br><br>Travel back in time 
as you descend into the Snake River Canyon. At the bottom of the 
canyon, imagine the volcano which created today's Yellowstone Park 
passing underneath your feet nearly 14 million years ago. Walk 
through a field of hundred-ton boulders that were deposited by one
 of the largest floods in geologic history, and discover thousand year-old
 petroglyphs inscribed by early Native Americans that are still visible 
today.
<br><br>
Idaho was a vast territory when gold and silver discoveries in the 
Owyhee Mountains brought miners and homesteaders. At the dawn 
of the 20th century, Swan Falls Dam, the first powerhouse on the 
Snake River was the birthplace of modern electricity -- the same 
standard used throughout the world today. Experience Idaho's 
western heritage. Museums, birds of prey, ancient sites, and mining 
towns along with the rugged outdoors are your invitation to create 
your own unique Idaho frontier adventure.
