During the mining boom Harpster boasted a hotel, a livery barn,
a harness shop, four saloons, two general stores, a drug store,
and a blacksmith shop.

William Jackson built a toll bridge here across the South Fork 
of the Clearwater River to meet the needs of travelers and 
packers. The area was known previously as Brownsville, 
Riverside and Bridgeport. In 1895 the town was named 
Harpster in honor of early settler Abraham Harpster. An 
expected railroad never reached here, but while they were 
active, local mines helped the area grow.
