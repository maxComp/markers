In 1968  The Great Rift is designated as a National Landmark by 
the Dept. of Interior; officially dedicated 1971. A large area of the 
Snake Rive Plain is covered by fresh basalt flows with numerous 
cinder cones, lava tubes, and small shield volcanoes.  The land is 
almost all owned by the U.S. government and has no developable 
resources.<br><br>
A small, but spectacular part of the Great Rift is enclosed by Craters 
of the Moon National Monument. The United States Bureau of Land 
Management owns most of the land adjacent to the existing national 
monument, and well over a decade ago they recommended that 
Congress designate the roadless portions of the Craters of the 
Moon lava flow and the nearby Wapi flow as a unit of the National 
Wilderness Preservation System.
