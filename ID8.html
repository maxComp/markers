<b>Appaloosa Horse Club and Museum</b> <br><br>Is located one mile west of Moscow.
 The land occupied by the Nez Perce was suited to raising horses and 
was better protected from enemy raids. The Nez Perce became 
excellent horsemen and, unlike other tribes, they practiced selective 
breeding of their horses by gelding the inferior stallions and trading 
off the poorer stock. As a result, the Nez Perce were able to produce 
better horses than other tribes. <br><br>The Nez Perce horse herds multiplied 
into the thousands and in an economy where horses equaled wealth, 
the Nez Perce became known as an affluent tribe. Meriwether Lewis, 
who happened to be a skilled horseman, wrote of the Nez Perce 
horses in his journal, "Their horses appear to be of an excellent race; 
they are elegantly formed, active and durable; in short many of them 
look like fine English coarsers [ sic ] and would make a figure in 
any country."
