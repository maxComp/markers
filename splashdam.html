Prior to the arrival of the railroad in 1912, the 
North Fork of the Payette River provided an 
avenue for logs destined to downstream mills 
in Horseshoe Bend and Emmett.
<br><br>
In 1903, $100,000 was spent to dynamite open 
a clear channel in the river. Splash Dams were
built to store logs. During the winter of 1903-04, 
logs were held in a 36-acre pond. In April, the logs 
were blasted loose when the main dam was opened. 
Less then half of the logs made it to the mills and 
four men lost their lives during the log drive. Later, 
the dams were utilized to float railroad ties. Timber 
interests were instrumental in the founding of 
Smith's Ferry and Long Valley.
