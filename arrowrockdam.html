<p>
Higher than any other dam from 1915
until 1934, Arrowrock still is an essential
part of the Boise Valley's irrigation system.<br><br>
Located six miles upstream from here,
Arrowrock is 350 feet high and 1,150 feet
wide. Built at a cost of $4,725,000 to
provide additional water storage to get
2,635 valley farms through dry summer
seasons, it had enough capacity to take
care of more than 1,000 new farms as
well. Its 18-mile canyon reservoir holds
280,000 acre-feet of water.
