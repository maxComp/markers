In 1862, a noted Western scout, Mose Milner, started Mount 
Idaho on his gold rush trail to Florence. <br><br>
Camas Prairie's major early town soon grew up here. But 
when civic leaders resisted a farm effort to organize a grange 
there in 1874, Grangeville grew up as a better-located town. 
Although Mount Idaho became county seat from 1875 to 1902 
and had an important Chinese community, Grangeville soon 
surpassed its older rival. Most of its early buildings have 
disappeared.
