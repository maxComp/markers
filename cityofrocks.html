A vast display of towering granite rocks
(16 miles southeast of here) attracted
emigrants who were on their way to
California.<br><br>
A gold rush visitor, July 14, 1849, reported
that "you can imagine among those
massive piles, church domes, spires,
pyramids ... with a little fancying you can
see (anything) from the Capitol at Washington
to a lowly thatched cottage."
Emigrants who never had seen anything
like that before were impressed by so many
"rocks of the most singular shapes." City of
Rocks is a National Historic Landmark as
well as a National Natural Landmark.
