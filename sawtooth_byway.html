The Sawtooth Scenic Byway has the distinction of being the 100th 
National Forest Scenic Byway. Beginning in Shoshone, the southern 
leg of the byway features the new Black Magic Canyon geological 
attraction. The route then rolls north through fertile agricultural 
land to the resort towns of Hailey, Ketchum, and Sun Valley.
<br><br>
From there, the road carves its way through the Boulder Mountains 
to Galena Pass, showcasing the ridge of the Sawtooth Mountains. 
Beyond, the rocks and woodlands of the rugged Sawtooth National
Recreation Area are packed with rivers, streams, and 300 alpine lakes,
 providing top-notch venues for a variety of year round activities. 
Wildlife watchers should stay alert; the 756,000-acre recreational 
area is home to many species of wildlife, induding pronghorn antelope,
 deer, elk, bear and wolves.
<br><br>
The northern tip of the byway terminates in Stanley, where the 
Sawtooth meets the Ponderosa Pine and Salmon River Scenic 
Byways. So no matter which way you drive in or out, you're in for 
a treat.
