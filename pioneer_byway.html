On this route, travelers can retrace some steps of Idaho's early 
pioneers and follow the historic path taken by early-day 
Yellowstone Park visitors. From Franklin, Idaho's oldest settlement, 
this byway heads north to Soda Springs and on to the Wyoming 
border. This route offers the shortest distance and time between 
Salt Lake City and Yellowstone Park.<br><br>
Along the way you can see the remnants of the first grist mill in 
Idaho, one of the original Yellowstone Highway markers, the 100+ 
year old Mormon Oneida Academy, the site of the massacre at Bear 
River, Devil's Hand, the Niter Ice Cave, Last Chance Canal, cinder 
cones from extinct volcanoes, a section of the OregonCalifornia Trail, 
and many other historical points of interest, documenting early settlement in 
this portion of Idaho.<br><br>
Soda Springs offers numerous opportunities for visitors. Among a 
variety of historic attractions, the town features the world's only 
captive geyser, with a plume of almost 100 feet. In addition, the 
nearby Formation Springs Nature Conservancy Area contains a 
travertine-formed cave and excellent waterfowl and wildlife viewing.
