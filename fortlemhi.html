In 1855, a group of Mormon missionaries
came north from Utah to found a remote
colony just below the bench east of here.<br><br>
A religious settlement rather than a
military fort, Salmon River Mission grew
to more than 100 settlers before Indian
trouble forced them to abandon the valley
in 1858. By that time, the missionaries
had baptized 100 Indians and had begun
irrigated farming in spite of ruinous
summer frosts and plagues of grasshoppers.
Some of the old mission ditches
are still used, and part of an old adobe
mission wall still stands at Fort Lemhi.
