Slaterville served as the steamboat port for the Clearwater 
gold rush, which followed mineral discoveries at Pierce in 1860. 
<br><br>Founded by Seth S. Slater, May 6, 1861, Slaterville 
(permanent population 50) had five edifices built mainly of 
colored blankets, two stores, two houses, and a saloon. When 
the Colonel Wright "snapped her towline on the Grand Rapids 
and went whirling through the Big Eddy" just below here, 
May 13, Lewiston was founded to replace the new port. One 
more steamer reached here June 1, but Slaterville was doomed.
