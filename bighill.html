On their way west to Oregon and California, emigrant wagons often crossed high
ridges in order to avoid gullies and
canyons.<br><br>
When he came here in 1843, Theodore
Talbot noted that he "had to cross a very
high hill, which is said to be the greatest
impediment on the whole route from the
United States (over 200 miles east of here)
to Fort Hall (over 120 miles farther west).
The ascent is very long and tedious, but
the descent is still more abrupt and
difficult. " Many wagons had to be let
down by ropes tied to trees that disappeared long ago.
