<p>
Seven tunnels - one a horseshoe more
than a quarter mile long - had to be
blasted in this canyon so that a railroad
could be completed to Grangeville in
1908.<br><br>
Building a railroad up this canyon was
exceptionally difficult and expensive.
Although they competed in Lewiston,
Union Pacific and Northern Pacific
officials decided to organize a separate
company, in which each of them had an
equal interest, to complete a Camas
Prairie line. Otherwise, neither would
have had enough traffic to operate
profitably.
