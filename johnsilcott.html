<p>
Pioneer businessman and politician. He owned and operated
ferries in the Lewiston and Spokane areas.
<br><br>
Early in the 1860s, John Silcott ran a ferryboat across the 
Snake River at Lewiston.  He soon put in a ferry across the 
Clearwater River and initiated operations on the Snake at 
Alpowa and on the Spokane River.  His wife Jane was the 
daughter of Nez Perce leader Chief Timothy.  A Silcott ferry 
tie post is still visible at the north end of 5th Street.
