Towering 2,500 feet high, two overlapping
rock domes form a 300,000-year-old butte
that dominates this lava plain.<br><br>
After a hot flow of molten rhyolite (acidic
rock) boiled up through older lava, a
second rhyolite dome pushed up a block
of earlier basalt on its northwest side.
They took many thousands of years to
reach their present shape, but geologically,
they are very recent structures.
