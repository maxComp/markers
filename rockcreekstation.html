An 1864 overland stage station at Rock
Creek, five miles south and a mile west of
here, offered a desert oasis for 40 years
before irrigated farming transformed this
area.<br><br>
James Bascom's 1865 store and Herman
Stricker's 1900 mansion have been
preserved there as reminders of pioneer
life in an isolated outpost. In addition to
freight wagons and Oregon Trail
emigrants, miners and ranchers came
from many miles to get their supplies
there.
