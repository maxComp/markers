Gold was struck in Boise Basin (over the
ridge to the east) in 1862, and the rush to
these new mines came through here.<br><br>
Traffic came by steamer up the Columbia
to Umatilla and then overland. At first
there were only pack and saddle trains,
but in 1864, John Hailey, a famous Idaho
pioneer, ran stages this way. A toll road up
Harris Creek was opened shortly, though
other routes to the Basin also developed,
freighters continued to come through
Horse Shoe Bend for many years. <br><br>
