An old Indian trail connected Elk City with mines in Montana 
when Idaho's gold rush spread there in 1862. <br><br>
Following a route developed by Nez Perce buffalo hunters, a 
host of miners and packers ascended a series of ridges 
overlooking the deep Salmon and Clearwater river canyons 
on their way to new gold fields. Long after local Indians and 
miners ceased to travel there, a single-lane forest road was 
constructed near that traditional Nez Perce thoroughfare in 
1934.
