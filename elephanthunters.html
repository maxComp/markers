Early day big game hunters, who occupied
lava caves around here more than
12,000 years ago, had a diet that included
elephants, camels and giant bison.<br><br>
When a gradual change to a warmer, drier
climate made local grasslands into more
desert, the elephant herds left for cooler
plains farther north. But 8,000 years ago,
bison still were available here. Indians
continued to hunt buffalo on these plains
until about 1840. Then they had to go to
Montana for their hunting trips.
