Idaho's highest peak, 12,662 feet, is
named for William E. Borah, who served
in the United States Senate from 1907
until his death in 1940.<br><br>
Ten or a dozen large but shallow inland
seas have covered this area in the past
billion years. They became a graveyard for
countless generations of sea creatures:
bones, shells, coral and microscopic
remains piled up through the eons into a
clay-and-limestone deposit thousands of
feet thick. During the past 10 or 20
million years, part of this deposit has been
thrust upward into the towering ridge you
see before you.
