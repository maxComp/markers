The Kootenai Tribe of Idaho has lived in their aboriginal 
homeland of Idaho, Montana and British Columbia for
thousands of years. <br><br>A unique culture, the 
Kootenai are known for their distinctive sturgeon-nose
canoe and their linguistically isolated language. After refusing
to leave their aboriginal lands for a reservation, individual Kootnai
Indians obtained allotments in the Bonner's Ferry area.
Many years of hardships resulted in a Declaration of War
on the United States in 1974 to obtain a land base for the
Kootenai Tribe of Idaho.  Efforts to broaden that base continue.
