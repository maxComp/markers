Colonel P.E. Connor set up the old town
of Soda Springs, now mostly flooded, and
an adjacent Army post near here May 20,
1863.<br><br>
The gold rush to Idaho had greatly
increased traffic on the Oregon Trail, and
the post was needed to protect travelers
from the Indians. Along with his troops,
Connor brought 160 settlers from Utah,
and the town they founded became the
Oneida County seat from 1864-66. It soon
declined, but in 1870, Brigham Young
visited here and established the present
townsite just east of the earlier location.
