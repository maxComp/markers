Visible directly across the river is a pit left
by large-scale hydraulic mining for gold
deposited in ancient gravel beds.<br><br>
Big nozzles, called "hydraulic giants,"
shot powerful streams of water against a
prehistoric river bed (now the bank of the
stream) to expose and wash down goldbearing
gravel, which then in the 1860s,
remained in use until recent economic
changes made gold mining unprofitable.
Many pits - some enormously larger than
this one - are left as reminders of the
mining days gone by.
