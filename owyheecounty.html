The name applied to these mountains and
the whole surrounding region is an
outdated spelling of the word "Hawaii."<br><br>
Fur-trading ships brought Hawaiian
natives - then called "Owyhees" - to the
Northwest. In 1818, Donald Mackenzie
brought the first big brigade of fur
hunters to the Snake River Valley. He sent
several Owyhees to trap in this region and
they never came back. Ever since
then, this has been called the Owyhee
country and Owyhee County carries on
the name. (Pronounce "Owyhee" and
"Hawaii" aloud - they sound similar.)
