A vast mountain wilderness, cut by the
mile deep Salmon River Canyon, stretches
across Idaho south and east of here.<br><br>
Travel through the Salmon River
Mountains always was hard in the early
days. An 1872 railway survey showed the
Salmon River Canyon to be too expensive
a route to build. Until a highway was
finished down White Bird Hill in 1921,
only some pack trails and a difficult
wagon road crossed the rugged mountain
barrier that separated north and south
Idaho.
