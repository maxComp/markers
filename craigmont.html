Not long before Camas Prairie railroad
service started here in 1908, rival towns
were started on each side of the track.<br><br>
The town of Vollmer began as a rail and
business center on the east, and Ilo (an
older town a mile away) moved to an
adjacent site on the west. Each had
separate schools, churches, stores,
newspapers, banks and other businesses.
After 12 years of sharp competition, they
finally merged into a united community
in 1920.
