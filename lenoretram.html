In 1898, after rail service from Lewiston reached Lenore, 
a tramway was begun to ship grain from Camas Prairie 
(1,600 feet above) to a new freight stop directly across the river. 
<br><br>Previously, grain wagons descended a long steep 
hill from the prairie. Gravity moved full tram buckets down, 
sending empty buckets back up the cable loop. By 1903, the 
completed system carried up to 100,000 bushels of grain 
each year. In 1937 a fire destroyed the entire system.
