Journeying toward the Clearwater River, six men under 
William Clark met the Nez Perce Indians not far from here, 
September 20, 1805. <br><br>Clark first saw three frightened Indian 
boys, who hid in the grass. Finding two, he reassured them 
with small presents and "sent them forward to the village." 
The Indian people, though naturally somewhat nervous in 
greeting the first whites to reach their land, fed Clark's men. 
The next day, Clark "collected a horse load of roots & 3 
Sammon" to send back to the main expedition.
