Archaeological excavations show human occupation of the Snake
 River plain for more than 10,000 years. <br><br>Early men left weapons
 and other gear in a cave in a nearby butte. Bones show that they
 hunted game that is now extinct - camels, ancient horses and 
ground sloths. In succeeding thousands of years the climate grew 
extremely dry, much drier than it is today. Still later, it 
became less arid again. Through all these changes, man 
succeeded in adapting and remained here.
