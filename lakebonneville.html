Twenty thousand years ago, this land was
underwater. <br><br>Not far to the north, you can
see the old shore of Lake Bonneville.
Formed in a basin from which no river
reached the ocean, this became the largest
lake in North America. Finally, the lake
rose enough to overflow into the Snake
River. Then, after the climate got drier
and the great basin of Utah and Nevada
became mostly a desert, the lake receded.
Salt Lake and two other remnants are all
that are left of this old 20,000-square mile
lake.
