<p>
For more than half a century after 1910,
an exceptionally large apple orchard
covered these hills around Mesa. <br><br>An
eight-mile wooden flume brought water
to these slopes.
Chicago and other distant investors
bought ten-acre shares in an orchard
company to pay for this expensive, 1,500-acre 
project. A town for 50 orchard
workers was built here, and a 3 1/2-mile
gravity tram hauled apples to a railroad
siding below Mesa. This ambitious
operation lasted until 1967.
