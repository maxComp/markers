South Central Idaho geography is the result of huge prehistoric 
cataclysmic forces making the breathtaking Snake River Canyon. The 
byway provides a glimpse into this remarkable geology, history, and a 
nostalgic rural lifestyle. Beginning at Bliss, the byway drops into 
the canyon providing a grand entrance, and visitors discover country 
towns, historic places, fish hatcheries, wildlife habitats, and 
recreational opportunities.
<br><br>
South of Hagerman, Thousand Springs is clearly visible from the byway.
This pure, dean oxygenated water maintains a constant temperature of 
58 degrees F, ideal conditions for growing trout. The hatcheries 
located along the 30-mile stretch of the Snake River in the Hagerman 
Valley raise 70 percent of the trout produced in the United States. 
Boat tours and dinner cruises available in the area allow visitors 
to get up-dose and personal with some of the Thousand Springs along
this stretch of the Snake River.
<br><br>
Travel on and enjoy small town delights and festivals such as the 
Trout Festival in Buhl  and Idaho's largest county fair in Filer, 
both in September. In Twin Falls visit Historic Downtown Twin Falls: 
home to unique shops and galleries. The City Park is the site of the 
historic bandshell and home of one of the country's longest playing 
city bands. Take a side trip to the 212-foot Shoshone Falls. The 
best viewing is in the early spring of high run-off years before the 
water is put to work irrigating the area's fertile farmland. The 
Centennial Trail, starting at Shoshone Falls Park, will take you to 
the Evel Knievel jump site, and provide a panoramic view of the area.
In the fall, travel to the South Hills via Hansen and Kimberly for 
spectacular fall foliage and trails for cycling, horseback riding 
and hiking. This area is home to some of the best winter recreation 
in the region.
