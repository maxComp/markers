A bad ford gave trouble to wagon trains
crossing this stream on the trail to
California and Oregon in 1849.<br><br>
In that year, gold-seeking 49'rs developed a shortcut that crossed here. Then
emigrants built two bridges here in 1850.
But an enterprising toll collector came
along and charged $1 per wagon, which
was more than some could afford. Penniless emigrants, who had to make an eightmile detour, cursed, while their richer
companions comfortably clattered across
both bridges.
