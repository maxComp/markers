In 1863 and 1864, overland packers
hauling supplies from Salt Lake City to
Idaho City crossed here and took a direct
route northward to More's Creek.<br><br>
They cut a steep grade from the Oregon
Trail down to Beaver Dick's Ferry, which
served as a crossing only a short distance
below here. After gold rush excitement
ended, Idaho City traffic came through
Boise and used a toll road further north to
Boise Basin.
