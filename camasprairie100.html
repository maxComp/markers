Named for the Blue Flowering Camas - an
important root food for all interior
Northwestern Indians - the Camas prairie
is a traditional Nez Perce cultural center.<br><br>
Tola Lake provided a
campground for Chief Joseph's Wallowa
band and White Bird's Salmon River band
when war broke out on the Salmon River
directly south of here, June 14, 1877.
Both of these bands were under military
pressure to settle on the Camas Prairie
when three young men from White Bird's
band avenged a long series of past wrongs
and Army authorities retaliated.
