This is an all natural, no frills, individualistic and unpretentious 
pathway through rural North Central Idaho. It is a 57-mile route to 
adventure, fun and relaxation for travelers of all types. Travelers 
quickly enter a vast evergreen forested landscape that draws one 
deeper and forward towards the horizon of the clearwater Mountain 
range. Through a series of dips and turns the route reveals the 
diversity of landscapes in this back country region of Idaho.
<br><br>
From Orofino the route begins with a climb up and along Wells Bench 
where ranchettes and farmsteads are scattered along the benches and 
between timber patches. As the forested areas get more prevalent,
 travelers will drop down towards Dworshak Reservoir, crossing Dent
 Bridge, which is a suspension bridge that provides a link to western 
Clearwater County and vast forest lands that built the local economy.
 Along the path there are opportunities to observe wildlife of many 
types: bear, bobcats, cougar, deer, elk, osprey, songbirds, wild turkeys,
 possibly wolves and a wide variety of the forest's small woodland
 creatures. <br><br>
Thirty-four miles from Orofino lies Elk River, a quaint 
community that has gone full circle: Established as a remote hunting 
and recreation camp, developed by Polatch as a mill town (site of the 
first electric powered mill), only to return to a recreational community
 in the twenty-first century.
