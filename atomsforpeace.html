An important page in atomic history was
written here on July 17, 1955, when the
lights of Arco were successfully powered
from atomic energy.<br><br>
Chosen by the Atomic Energy Commission
as an experiment in the peaceful use
of atomic power, Arco, Idaho, became the
first town in the free world to be served
by electrical energy developed from the
atom. The energy for this experiment was
produced at the National Reactor Testing
Station in the Arco desert southwest of
here.
