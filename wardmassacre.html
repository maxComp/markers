Only two young boys survived the Indian
attack on Alexander Ward's 20-member
party, which was Oregon-bound on
August 20, 1854.<br><br>
Military retaliation for the slaughter so
enraged the Indians that Hudson's Bay Co.
posts Fort Boise and Fort Hall had to be
abandoned, and the Oregon Trail became
unsafe without army escort. Eight years of
conflict followed. Finally, the 1862 gold
rush brought powerful forces, civilian and
military, that gradually subdued the
tribes.
