Excluded from their West Coast homes by
military authorities, more than 9,000
Japanese Americans occupied Hunt
relocation camps four miles north of here
between 1942 and 1945.<br><br>
Until they could resettle in other places,
they lived in wartime tarpaper barracks in
a dusty desert, where they helped meet a
local farm labor crisis, planting and
harvesting crops. Finally, a 1945 Supreme
Court decision held that United States
citizens no longer could be confined that
way, and their camp became Idaho's
largest ghost town.
