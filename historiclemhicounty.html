In 1866, gold was discovered at Leesburg by
Elijah Mulkey, William Smith, F.B. Sharkey,
Joseph Rapp and Ward Girton.<br><br>
Mining has continued in Lemhi County, with
production of $30 million in gold and nearly
$35 million in copper, lead, tungsten, silver,
etc. Sixty-three mineral species have been
found. In August 1805, Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark entered the Lemhi Valley 20
miles south of here and later crossed Idaho
75 miles north of here on their way to the
Pacific Ocean. In 1832, Captain Bonneville
occupied the valley four miles north, representing
the U.S. in Oregon Territory. In 1855,
a Mormon settlement was established at Fort
Lemhi near the place where Lewis and Clark
first encamped. It was abandoned in 1858.
Agriculture and stock were established in 1870.
