When their annual Montana plains
buffalo hunt proved futile in 1876, north
Idaho's Coeur d' Alene Indians needed
to move from Cataldo to a better
farming area.<br><br>
So in 1877, their Jesuit mission was
located there. After their community
grew large enough, a three - story school
building - still preserved by Coeur d'
Alene Tribal Council authorities - was
built in 1900. It serves as a community
cultural center for Desmet.
