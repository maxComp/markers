The Mesa Falls Scenic Byway begins at the junction of U.S. 20 and 
Idaho 47, near the northern terminus of the Teton Scenic Byway in
 Ashton, Idaho. <br><br>From Ashton, the route travels through the 
Warm River area towards its main attractions, Upper and Lower Mesa 
Falls. At 114 feet and 65 feet respectively, the Upper and Lower 
Falls offer equally spectacular views in a beautiful forest setting. 
Both falls can be viewed in full, Lower Falls from a quarter mile 
distance, Upper Falls from just a few feet away. The area near
 Upper Falls is enhanced with pathways, stairs and viewing 
platforms. These improvements lead visitors to the brink of the 
falls, close enough to feel the power of the cascading water. Some 
of the pathways and viewing platforms are universally accessible. 
<br><br>The historic Big Falls Inn (fee site) at Upper Falls has been restored 
to its original splendor and it is now open seasonally (approximately 
May 15th thru October 1st) as an interpretive center. Though the 
byway is less than an hour's driving time, viewing the falls, touring 
the interpretive center, enjoying a picnic lunch and making stops
 to view wildflowers can easily fill half a day.
