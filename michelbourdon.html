This valley was discovered in 1822 by a
party of Hudson's Bay Co. trappers led by
Michel Bourdon.<br><br>
Bourdon had come to the Northwest with
David Thompson, who had started the
Idaho fur trade in 1808-09. Trappers
searched everywhere for beaver and were
active south of here for years before
Bourdon took them farther into this
mountain wilderness. Fur hunting went
on for another decade in these parts
before the country was trapped out and
abandoned by the fur traders.
