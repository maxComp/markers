<p>
With a grubstake of one jackass and
$18.75 worth of flour, bacon and beans,
Noah Kellogg came here prospecting in
1885.<br><br>
Not far from here, his jackass strayed
away. Kellogg finally found his wandering
burro grazing on a tremendous outcropping
of galena on the hillside above
Wardner, about two miles south of here.
Such was the discovery of the world famous
Bunker Hill mine, which has
produced more than 28 million tons of
lead, silver and zinc - and the end is
not yet in sight.
