Until about 28,000 years ago, the Bear
River used to flow northwest from here
through the Portneuf Canyon into the
Snake River.<br><br>
Lava eruptions blocked that route,
diverting the Bear River south into what is
now Salt Lake. At that time, a large inland
sea - known as Lake Bonneville - covered
much of Utah. Additional water from the
Bear River helped it overflow into the
Snake River before a change in climate
dried it up about 8,000 years ago.
