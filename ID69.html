    <br><br>The World Center For Birds of Prey<br>
    It all started with the Peregrine</b>
<br>The Peregrine Fund was founded in 1970 to restore the Peregrine Falcon, 
which was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 1999. That 
success encouraged the organization to expand its focus and apply its 
experience and understanding to raptor conservation efforts on behalf 
of more than 100 species in 65 countries worldwide, including the 
California Condor and Aplomado Falcon in the United States. The 
organization is non-political, solution-oriented and hands-on.
