When Lewis and Clark came up this ridge, June 29, 1806, 
they ran into "A shower of rain, with hail, thunder and
 lightning, that lasted about an hour."<br><br> But they got 
out of deep Lolo Trail snow after they reached Rocky Point 
(directly across from here) and descended to Crooked Fork, 
below this turnout. They reported that then they "ascended a 
very steep acclivity of a mountain about two miles" crossing 
this highway here to reach their old trail to Lolo Pass.
