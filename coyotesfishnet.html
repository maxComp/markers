A Nez Perce Indian legend tells how
Coyote and Black Bear had a falling out
while fishing here long ago.<br><br>
Coyote, the all-powerful animal spirit,
was having a good time until Black Bear,
the busybody, began to tease him. Finally,
losing his temper, Coyote tossed his huge
fishnet onto the hills across the river. To
teach Black Bear a lesson, Coyote threw
him to the top of the hill on his side and
turned him to stone. The Nez Perce
people know just where to look for the
net and unfortunate bear.
