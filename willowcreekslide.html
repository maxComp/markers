A spectacular avalanche on February 10,
1903, swept away part of a trestle - 300
feet high - that let Northern Pacific
Railway trains descend from this pass
since 1890.<br><br>
An engine that plunged 80 feet was buried
in 30 feet of snow; a passenger car
dangled over open space; and a caboose
with eight people dropped into a deep
snowbank. Miraculously, everyone aboard
survived that terror-stricken trip. But a
new, less-hazardous grade replaced that
trestle route.
