Archaeological research has traced human occupation of this 
valley back more than 10,000 years. <br><br>The first 
men here found the valley forested. As the climate became 
drier, other mountain dwellers - known to archaeologists as 
people of the Bitterroot culture - settled here, perhaps about 
8,000 years ago. These forerunners of the modern northern 
Shoshoni Indians lived in family bands and hunted big game, 
such as bison and mountain sheep.
