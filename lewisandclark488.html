On May 31, 1806, Sgt. John Ordway and
Pvts. Frazer and Weiser began the return
trip from Lewis's River (Snake River) with
salmon for Camp Chopunnish (Kamiah).<br><br>
The men crossed the Camas Prairie near
here on their way to rejoin the Corps of
Discovery, waiting in Camp Chopunnish
for mountain snows to recede before
attempting to cross the Bitterroots. At
about noon on June 2, the small group
arrived with seventeen salmon and some
roots they had purchased. Most of the fish
were spoiled, but Lewis described those
that were sound as "extremely delicious."
