At the top of this hill 3,000 to 5,000 years
ago, prehistoric men had a rock quarry
where they made a variety of stone tools.<br><br>
Projectiles, knives and scrapers were
among the tools made by these early
people who camped at the foot of the hill.
These nomads hunted deer and other
game, collected plant foods and fished in
the river here. They had spears and spear
throwers for hunting and fishing, and
mortars and pestles for grinding roots and
berries. Archaeologists have not yet
determined when this industry shut
down.
