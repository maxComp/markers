Lead-silver discoveries in 1884 attracted a
railroad to Burke by 1887. Hundreds of
miners lived there in a canyon so narrow
that they scarcely had room for streets.<br><br>
So in 1888, S.S. Glidden's Tiger Hotel had
to be built over, rather than beside,
Canyon Creek. Railroad tracks and
Burke's only highway also had to run
through his hotel. When a second railroad
arrived in 1890, its tracks had to be laid
in Burke's only street. No other hotel had
two railroads, a street and a stream
running through it.
