Guiding Oregon Trail emigrants and a party of prospectors 
who had discovered gold in Boise Basin, Tim Goodale opened 
a new miners' trail through here in August 1862. <br><br>A gold rush 
followed that fall, and John Brownlee operated a ferry here 
from 1862 to 1864, before leaving to work his own Boise 
Basin mine. A new ferry commenced here a year after 
James Ruth and T.J. Heath discovered silver mines on 
Brownlee Creek in 1874, with service continuing until after 
1920.
