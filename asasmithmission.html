A Massachusetts Congregationalist, Smith spent two years 
here learning the Nez Perce language and starting a mission. <br><br>Coming here 
May 10, 1839, to study with Lawyer, an important Nez Perce 
leader, he stayed to work on an Indian dictionary and to hold 
daily religious classes each spring and winter. After spending 
six months in a "mere hovel," he finished a comfortable home 
and started a garden of several acres. But he never got used
 to pioneer life here. Leaving Kamiah April 19, 1841, he moved 
to a mission in Hawaii.
