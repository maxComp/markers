<p>
In more than a century after rich lodes
were discovered in 1884, this valley has
become North and South America's largest
producer of silver.<br><br>
More than $5 billion worth of lead, silver
and zinc - including more than a billion
ounces of silver - have come from these
camps. Old mines and towns at Burke,
Kellogg, Murray, Mullan, Osburn and
Wardner can be reached from Wallace.
First, visit the Coeur d'Alene Mining
Museum at 509 Bank Street in Wallace to
review the region's mining development.
