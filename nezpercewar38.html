A Gatling gun, firing from the top of a
low hill a mile northwest of here, beat off
a Nez Perce attack, July 4, 1877.<br><br>
The next day, Indians just east of here
surrounded 17 Mount Idaho volunteers:
two were killed and three wounded before
cavalrymen from Cottonwood came out to
rescue them. Meanwhile, Chief Joseph's
people, screened this well-planned
diversionary skirmish, crossed the prairie
to join their allies on the Clearwater.
From there the Indians retired across the
mountains to Montana, where the Nez
Perce War ended three months later.
