<p>
High on Island Park Caldera's west rim, a
72-foot-high Forest Service lookout tower
affords an excellent view of this large
volcanic feature.<br><br>
No other steel tower has been preserved
in this part of Idaho. When it was erected
in 1936, lookouts were essential for fire
detection in all of this region's forests.
This one still is used in times of especially
severe fire hazard, but planes now are
responsible for regular fire patrol. Forest
Service road 80120 ascends to the Bishop
Mountain Lookout at an elevation of
7,810 feet.
