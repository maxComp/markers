Built by the Army in 1880 to carry hay
and supplies for Fort Coeur d'Alene, the
"Amelia Wheaton" was the first of a long
list of steamers on this lake.<br><br>
Commercial steamboating began in 1884
with the mining rush. In later years, fleets
of tall-funnelled boats hauled freight,
towed logs, and carried passengers and
excursionists. Steamers served the lake
and river communities until highways
changed the transportation pattern.
