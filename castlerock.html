Up toward Camas Prairie, this road goes
by Castle Rock and other eroded granite
outcrops that were landmarks on
Goodale's Cutoff, an Oregon Trail route
that came this way.<br><br>
Emigrants generally had not seen large
granite rock formations of this kind, and
Idaho offered a number of good opportunities,
both for Oregon and California
travelers. Castle Rock and its neighbors
were outstanding examples along
Goodale's Cutoff. The trail was used
primarily from 1862 until automobiles
replaced wagon traffic more than 40
years later.
