Gold miner's rushing to Wild Horse in
British Columbia in 1863 were paddled
across this river by Indians.<br><br> In 1864, E.L.
Bonner established a proper ferry here.
The ferry and its trading store served the
Wild Horse pack trains for many years.
Steamers - the first tiny one dragged in
overland - came to the river in the 1880s
and the Great Northern Railway arrived in
1892. A thriving town soon sprang up
where once the ferryman and his family
had been the only white people.
