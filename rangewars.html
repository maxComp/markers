Armed cattle ranchers delayed farm settlement here for six 
years before a permanent farm community was organized in 
1872. <br><br>This kind of conflict occurred in widely scattered 
Western areas when farm crops displaced range land. Families 
of early farm pioneers still occupy holdings here that are well 
over a century old, although many of them finally shifted from 
planting crops to raising cattle after winning their battle 
against early stock herders.
