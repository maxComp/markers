Oro Fino City was the commercial center of Idaho's earliest 
gold camp in the great days of 1861. <br><br>It flourished here 
for more than a year. Pierce City was only two miles away, 
but another town sprang up near some rich gold strikes. In its 
first few weeks, Oro Fino City had "about 60 houses -  more 
going up every day; nine or 10 stores, more saloons than are 
needed, two smith shops, two butcher shops, three families, 
and about 500 inhabitants." But with the gold rush over, the 
place was abandoned. The deserted town burned to the ground, 
August 10, 1867.
