Searching the mountain wilderness for beaver, Alexander Ross 
came up the Wood River and discovered this summit, 
September 18, 1824. <br><br>Leading a large brigade of 
Hudson's Bay Co. trappers, he wondered whether he could 
get through unknown mountains and rocky defiles that 
obstructed his passage back to his base of operations at 
present Challis. Unwilling to turn back, he pressed on to 
explore Stanley Basin and the difficult canyon beyond. 
When he reached Challis on October 6, he had traveled this 
highway route from Bellevue to Salmon, mostly through 
unexplored land.
