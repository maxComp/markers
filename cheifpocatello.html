In an era of emigrants, Mormon settlers and
the military, Pocatello emerged as a strong
leader of the Hukenduka Shoshone.<br><br>
Born after 1810, Pocatello claimed this area and
surrounding territories as his homeland. He soon
watched his people endure brutality, disease and
starvation. For retaliating, he was nearly hanged
until President Lincoln intervened. After 1875,
he lived a reservation life until his death around
1884. He was buried in a bottomless spring
with 18 horses.
