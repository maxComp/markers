An old ferry near here took thousands of eager fortune hunters 
to a trail that climbed out of this canyon to rich gold fields 
discovered at Pierce in 1860. <br><br>You still can follow 
their spectacular route to Weippe Prairie, where in 1805 
Lewis and Clark met a Nez Perce band that helped save 
their expedition. Continuing on, you can reach Idaho's 
oldest public building -  Pierce Courthouse, built in 1862. 
Take State Highway 11.
