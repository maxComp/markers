The Hells Canyon Scenic Byway winds its way along the east side 
of this massive rift that separates Idaho from neighboring Oregon. 
While the view from the road is breathtaking, a guided float trip or 
jet boat tour of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area is a must. 
Towering cliffs of black and green basalt hang so high above the 
Snake River and its sandy beaches that boaters strain their necks to 
see these places. Outfitters offer one-to six-day trips.
<br><br>
Look for wildlife including mountain goats, Big Horn sheep, bald 
eagles and great fishing. During the summer months, visit the Hells 
Canyon Creek Visitors Center just below Hells Canyon Dam, the 
entrance to the wild and scenic part of the Snake River.
<br><br>
Today, walls of the canyon are like a museum, where pictographs and 
petroglyphs display evidence of the Indians' early settlements. The 
surrounding area was the home of Chief Joseph's band of Nez Perce
 Indians. Other tribes, including the Shoshone, Bannock, North 
Paiute and Cayuse Indians, were frequent visitors to the area. 
These tribes were drawn to the region by relatively mild winters, 
lush foliage and plentiful wildlife.
