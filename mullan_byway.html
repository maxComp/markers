Lewis and Clark get all the glory, but it was Army officer John Mullan
 who really opened the Inland Northwest to white settlement.
His 624-mile Mullan Road, completed in 1862, connected the Missouri 
and Columbia rivers and paved the way for soldiers, settlers and 
miners to pour into parts of Montana, Idaho and Washington.
<br><br>
Mullan is little remembered these days, even though his military road 
was an engineering landmark. "The Mullan Road became the 
transcontinental passage that President Jefferson and Meriwether
 Lewis originally envisioned, but which in fact did not exist because 
of the difficulties of the traverse over the Rockies." <br><br>
The dirt road was constructed from 1859 to 1862, cost $230,000, and 
ran from Ft. Benton, Mont. -- end of the line for steamboats up the 
Missouri -- to Walla Walla, Wash., the last navigable point of the 
Columbia.
<br><br>
The road was used for more than a decade before it was rendered 
obsolete by transcontinental railroads. Today, Interstate 90 mirrors 
much of the old trail through Montana and Idaho.<br><br>
Mullan may have faded from public consciousness, but there are 
many signs of his legacy. They include the small town of Mullan, 
Idaho, which has a museum and statue of the road builder. There 
are schools named in his honor, and a portion of I-90 is known as 
the Capt. John Mullan Highway.
<br><br>
There are also a series of roadside monuments in Montana, Idaho and
 Washington. They were erected early in the 20th century after a 
burst of publicity tied to Mullan's death in 1909 in Washington, D.C.
A series of six 14-foot-tall white statues in Montana and Idaho show 
a jaunty Mullan with his hand on his hip, rifle in the other hand and 
a pistol in his belt.
<br><br>
After Lewis and Clark, the U.S. Army paid little attention to the 
Inland Northwest for nearly 50 years until the railroad survey of 
1853 by Gen. Isaac Stevens. Mullan was a member of that survey, 
which was trying to find a way to link the Missouri and Columbia.
<br><br>
Stevens decided that a railroad through the mountains was years 
away, but building a road was practical. Mullan, a graduate of West 
Point, was placed in charge.  "Mullan became the equivalent of the
 great pathfinder for the Inland Northwest." 

Unlike the popular image of civilization moving west, the Mullan Road
 mainly carried people from the Pacific coast to inland areas.

"A lot of settlement in the Inland Northwest came up from Portland 
and other parts of Oregon." 

"He and Isaac Stevens are the Lewis and Clark for our region."
<br><br>
Born in 1830 in Norfolk, Va., Mullan was nearly 29 when he started 
leading a crew of 70 men in construction of the road at Ft. Walla 
Walla on July 1, 1859.

The first 100 miles were light work because most of it was rolling 
prairie. When they reached the mountains, workers had to chop 
and clear trees, make cuts in hillsides, and build bridges and ferries 
over water.

The road was intended to be used by wagons, although in parts of 
the mountains, it resembled little more than a trail.

Operating in the Idaho Panhandle from August to early December 
1859, "workers cut through this densely timbered section of 100 
miles, building small bridges where required, grading in thousands
 of places including ... an ascent of 1 3/4 miles, to the summit of 
the Bitterroot mountains." 

<br><br>
Anxious to prove the military value of the road, Mullan requested that
 the Army send 300 soldiers to Ft. Benton with enough supplies to 
get to Ft. Walla Walla in 60 days.

The request was approved and on May 3, 1860, a 300-man contingent
 left St. Louis on three steamers. They landed at Ft. Benton on 
July 2 and waited for Mullan, who arrived Aug. 1.

"I had a long talk with Mullan about his road and his troubles," Lt.
 August V. Kautz wrote in his diary of the trip.

"He is decidedly more monomaniacal in his demonstrations than I 
ever knew him. He imagines everybody who is not in favor of his 
road to be against it."
<br><br>
A month later, Mullan began the return trip on the new road, 
making improvements along the way. Exhausted from his labors, 
Mullan wrote that "my health during this time had seriously 
failed me."

The Army contingent that followed him was the only important
 movement of military troops over the Mullan Road, and it arrived at 
Ft. Walla Walla on Oct. 4, 1860, 50 days after it left Ft. Benton.

"Thus ended this military experiment," Mullan wrote.
<br><br>
Construction was estimated to involve 120 miles of timber cutting, 
30 miles of excavation, the traversing of 424 miles of open timbered 
country and rolling prairie, and the building of hundreds of bridges 
and several ferryboats.

In May 1861, Mullan again traveled the road from west to east, 
making repairs and improvements. He returned to Walla Walla in 
late August.

I disposed of my property at public auction, disbanded my expedition
 and on the 11th of September started for Washington City to make 
my report to the War Department.

"Thus ended my work in the field, costing seven years of close and 
arduous attention," he wrote.
<br><br>
Mullan eventually married and published a guide for travelers along 
his road. He secured a contract to deliver mail and freight from 
California to Idaho. After that failed, he moved to San Francisco 
and became a lawyer.

Eventually he returned to Washington, D.C., and became national 
commissioner of Indian schools.

In 1883, he traveled to Montana to attend the ceremony marking 
completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad, riding over portions of 
his former road in a rail car.

He died in his home on Dec. 28, 1909, at age 79.
<br><br>
In 1978, the American Society of Civil Engineers recognized the 
Mullan Road as a National Historic Engineering Landmark, 
calling it the first route in the Pacific Northwest "whose location 
was selected on the basis of extensive exploratory engineering 
reconnaissance surveys."

There are still isolated patches of the original road in some remote 
areas. But much of the road was eventually paved over, plowed up 
or consigned to forests that were logged off.
