Farmhouses and pioneer buildings of an
old Mormon community have been
preserved at Chesterfield, 16 miles north
of here.<br><br>
Located in 1879 by a Mormon bishop,
Chesterfield offered a good opportunity to
farmers from Utah, which then was
becoming overcrowded. Within two years,
a group of settlers helped construct a
nearby railroad that made their town grow
to more than 400 people. Chesterfield
thrived for more than a generation before
new trends in farming and transportation
led to its decline.
