John Grey discovered this valley in 1818 or 1819 while
 hunting beaver for Donald Mackenzie's North West Co. trappers.<br><br>
 An Iroquois leader, also known as Ignace Hatchioraquasha, 
he also explored Grey's River nearby in Wyoming. Aside from 
his trapping skills, he was noted for his unusual aptitude in 
fighting grizzly bears. After trapping in this country for 20 
years, he retired with his Iroquois band in 1836 to help found 
Kansas City, Missouri.
