<br>The Overland Astorians headed up the Missouri River in the 
spring of 1811. Among the sixty-five people who left the 
Arikara villages in present-day South Dakota on horseback 
in July were Pacific Fur Company partner Donald McKenzie, 
along with their interpreter Pierre Dorian Jr., his Iowa Indian wife 
Marie, and their two young sons. As well as scribe Alexander Ross and
hunter John Day.
<br><br> 
Astor had chosen partner Wilson Price Hunt, who had no 
experience in wilderness travel, to lead the overland group 
because of his business expertise. They were 
to have followed the trail established by Lewis and Clark, 
however, multiple reports of Blackfoot hostilities in the 
Three Forks area caused the brigade to transfer their goods 
from keelboats and barges to horses at the Arikara Villages.
Their guides had spent 
the winter in present day Idaho with fur trader Andrew Henry at 
Fort Henry.
<br><br>
The company descended the Snake River in canoes in October, 
but they soon lost one man and several boatloads of goods 
in the raging water. With winter coming on in late October, 
the men decided to abandon the river just east of present-day
 Twin Falls, Idaho, and continue on foot. They named this 
point Caldron Linn. On the verge of 
starvation, they split and reunited into various groups 
with eleven men 
making their way into present day northern Idaho and enduring
 the brutal winter with help from Nez Perce Indians, who fed 
them and sold them canoes. That group arrived at Astoria by 
way of the Snake and Columbia Rivers in January 1812. In 
February, Hunt and thirty-three others reached Fort Astoria 
after taking a route north of present-day Ontario. 
<br><br>
Astor's grand venture was plagued by mismanagement and 
conflicts with Native people but most of all by the War of 
1812 and the partners' fear of attacks by British ships. 
By the summer of 1813, the 
partners at Astoria had decided to abandon the post. Hunt 
certainly would have objected, but he was away from the post 
on a trading mission. Astor's dream of a lucrative 
international fur trade ended with more than sixty men dying
 in the effort.
<br><br>
The Astor expedition left a lasting legacy in the route that 
Astorian Robert Stuart discovered on his return trip from 
Astoria to St. Louis, an easy and low passage over the Rocky 
Mountains at South Pass. That key section of what became the 
Oregon Trail would greatly benefit tens of thousands of 
pioneers headed for Oregon, Utah, or California.
