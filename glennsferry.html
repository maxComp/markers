Heavy Boise freight traffic from Pacific rail
terminals in Utah and Nevada led Gus
Glenn to start a ferry here in 1870.<br><br>
This crossing (just below I-84's bridges)
connected to a shorter and better freight
road. James S. Reynolds noted its
advantages: "By it King Hill, Clear Creek
Hill and that horrid road between Canyon
Creek and Rattlesnake are avoided."
Indians captured and sank Glenn's ferry
during a Bannock War skirmish here in
1878. But overland stage service started
here in 1879, and lasted until Glenn's
Ferry became an important railroad
center in 1883.
