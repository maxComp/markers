Indians, trappers and emigrants who
came this way before 1900 used a more
direct route to get between Boise and
Glenn's Ferry. <br><br>Their road still can be seen
at Bonneville Point, five miles from here.
Following close to a line of hills bordering
a broad, rolling plain, their route had
water and grass essential for horses and
oxen. It also gave them a spectacular view
of the Boise valley. To see that site, follow
directional signs when you reach
Interchange 64 at Blacks Creek, one mile
beyond here.
