In 1806, Lewis and Clark waited six weeks for deep snow to 
melt on the high ridges of the Lolo Trail to the east of here. <br><br>
Their route home blocked, they spent four of the six weeks 
(May 14-June 10) at their long camp across the river. They 
hunted, fished and amused themselves showing the Nez Perce 
Indians "the power of magnetism, the spyglass, the compass, 
watch, air gun and sundry other articles equally novel and 
incomprehensible to them." Finally, with three Indian guides, 
they got away on their long journey back to the United States.
