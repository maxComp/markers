The Wild Horse Trail Scenic Byway is part of the International 
Selkirk Loop, designated North America's only International
 Scenic Byway. The Byway starts on the northwestern shores 
of Lake Pend Oreille in the resort community of Sandpoint. 
Heading north along the eastern side of the Selkirk Mountains
 the roadway follows the Kootenai Tribe's historic path to fishing
 grounds at Lake Pend Oreille. <br><br>In 1808 the first white explorer 
David Thompson also utilized this trail. The "Wild Horse Trail" 
became more than a path in 1863 when gold was discovered in
 "Wild Horse Creek" 120 miles to the north of Bonners Ferry 
Idaho in British Columbia. There was a large movement of men 
and pack animals along the "Wild Horse Trail" until the gold 
rush ceased circa 1880. <br><br>
Upon arrival of the Northern Pacific railroad to this region 
David Thompson's old route became a main freight line for 
the railroad. <br><br>Just south of Bonners Ferry a stunning 
wide glacial valley comes into view. The rich soil deposits left 
behind as the glaciers receded formed fertile lands which even 
today support a wide variety of agriculture throughout the 
Kootenai Valley. <br><br>The Kootenai National Wildlife 
Refuge west of Bonners Ferry and the McArthur Lake Wildlife 
Management area offers a wealth of recreational opportunities 
including wildlife viewing, bird watching and hiking trails. 
There are six major access roads leading into the Selkirk 
Mountains onto Panhandle National Forest lands where 
recreational opportunities for hiking, fishing, camping, Nordic 
skiing and snowmobiling can be enjoyed.
