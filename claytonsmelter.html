Lead-silver mineral discoveries 12 miles north of here on 
Bayhorse Creek in 1864 and 1872 led Joel E. Clayton to 
locate a large smelter here in 1880. <br><br>Doubled in 
size in 1888, Clayton's smelter had enough variety of ores
 from local mines to continue production until 1902. A modern 
flotation plant followed for six years after 1919. When silver 
prices rose in 1935, Clayton became southern Idaho's primary 
silver producer, operating steadily for more than 50 years.
