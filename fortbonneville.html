In a grove of cottonwoods across the river,
Captain B.L.E. Bonneville established a
winter fur trade post, September 26, 1832.<br><br>
His fort - described by a rival trapper as
"a miserable establishment" - "consisted
of several log cabins, low, badly constructed
and admirably situated for
besiegers only, who would be sheltered on
every side by timber, brush, etc." But
several bands of friendly Flathead and
Nez Perce Indians camped nearby, and
Bonneville fully enjoyed his hunter's life
here in the midst of "a wild and bustling
scene."
