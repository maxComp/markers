On Aug. 13, 1896, Butch Cassidy and his
infamous Wild Bunch of gunmen invaded
Montpelier's banks and scooped up more
than $16,500 in gold, silver and currency.<br><br>
Leaving a surprised cashier and his
terrified customers, they calmly rode
away. A deputy sheriff who borrowed a
bicycle to pursue them up Montpelier
Canyon was quickly outdistanced.
Cassidy never was caught, but Bob Meeks
was imprisoned until 1912 for helping in
Montpelier's great bank robbery.
