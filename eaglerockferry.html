On June 20, 1863, Bill Hickman started a
ferry nine miles up the Snake River for
thousands of gold hunters headed for
mines that now are in Montana.<br><br>
Named for an eagle that had a nest on a
rock here, his ferry flourished for two
years. In 1864, J. Matt Taylor took it over
and got an Idaho franchise to run it until
he built a bridge here. Miners from Soda
Springs and freighters from Salt Lake City
all used Eagle Rock Ferry during
Montana's gold rush.
