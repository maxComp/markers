<p>
Water from deep snow that falls on high
mountain ridges north of here is stored
each spring in this reservoir to irrigate
farmland near Shoshone and Richfield.<br><br>
The Big Wood River flows past some hills
that separate this valley from a broad
plain of lava and windblown soil. This
border area provides an excellent storage
site for more than 190,000 acre-feet of
irrigation water. Magic Reservoir, created
in 1910, provides recreation opportunities
and a home for fish and wildlife in a
desert setting.
