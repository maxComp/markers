In order to cross Lawyer's Canyon and
other Camas Prairie gorges, a series of
high railroad bridges was built in 1908.<br><br>
This highway goes past two of them here.
Most were timber, but a metal structure,
1,500 feet long and 296 feet high, was
needed here. A long, high wooden trestle
also crossed a nearby side canyon. North
Idaho's Camas Prairie Railroad - a joint
Northern Pacific and Union Pacific
venture - served this region for eight
decades.
