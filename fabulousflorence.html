Millions in gold, mined mostly in one big
year, came from the high mountain basin
around Florence, 14 airline miles east of
here.<br><br>
Early prospectors, fanning south from
Pierce - Idaho's first gold camp - came
unexpectedly upon rich ground in August
1861. Their secret leaked, golden rumors
started an eager rush that fall and winter
famine followed. Next spring, thousands
stampeded into Florence, even from the
California mines. But the rich camp had
only 575 men by 1863. Today, scarcely a
trace of the town remains among scars of
the old diggings. The original town has
vanished.
