The northern end of the Salmon River Scenic Byway begins on 
the Montana border at the Lost Trail Pass (elevation 6,995 feet). 
Lewis and Clark came this way in 1805, and the spectacular view 
from this vantage point has changed little since that famous 
exploration of the West two centuries ago. 
<br><br>The route follows the Salmon River - also called the 
River of No Return - through the Salmon-Challis
National Forest through the historic city of Salmon. The river and
 its forks serve as important natural pathways into Idaho's rugged 
back country. The deer, elk, and moose that often graze along the
 hills and meadows that line this road provide a glimpse of the 
wild country beyond.<br><br> 
Along the way, the town of Challis and the Land of the Yankee 
Fork Historic Area are just two points of interest, the latter being 
among Idaho's most famous mining areas. And as you head 
southwest along Idaho 75 toward Stanley, you'll begin to see
 glimpses of the majestic Sawtooth Mountains ahead before
 beholding their full splendor as you drop into town.
