Rich strikes in 1879 led to a rush to the lead-silver mines of 
this valley. <br><br>Eventually, the famous Minnie Moore Mine alone 
produced a total of $8.4 million worth of ore. Mining quickly 
brought a railroad and prosperity, and for a time this was the 
leading region of Idaho. Hailey had Idaho's earliest phone 
service (1883) and three daily newspapers. A Ketchum 
smelter pioneered electric lighting in Idaho. But times 
changed: lodes ran out, mining declined, and now these 
hills attract more skiers than miners.
