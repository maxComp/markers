<p>
The Oregon Trail is still clearly visible
coming off the rimrock across the river.<br><br>
Here the westbound emigrants after 1840
came gratefully down into this green valley:
The first cart passed here with Henry H.
Spalding and Marcus Whitman, pioneer
missionaries, in 1836. After 1842, thousands
of emigrant wagons cut a broad track, later
called the Overland Road. The tide of travel
declined when the railroad was completed
in 1883, but emigrant wagons continued to
use this road until after 1900. The tracks of
the wagons and stages can still be followed
for miles east in the desert.
