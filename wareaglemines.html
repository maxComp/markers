For a decade after 1864, most of Silver
City's fabulous mineral wealth came from
upper War Eagle Mountain, which rises a
vertical mile above here.<br><br>
With lodes far richer than those found
elsewhere, War Eagle miners fought a
series of violent wars for control of
valuable claims. Troops from Fort Boise
finally had to intervene in one armed
clash in 1868. San Francisco bank failures
ended production there in 1875, and
thriving camps became ghost towns.
