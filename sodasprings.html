In this area is a group of springs famous
to Oregon Trail travelers, most of whom
stopped to try the "acid taste and
effervesing gasses" of the waters.<br><br>
Earlier fur traders, often less elegantly,
called the place "Beer Springs" after one
spring whose water tasted "like lager beer
... only flat." Another, Steamboat Springs,
made sounds "exactly resembling ... a
high pressure steam engine." Both springs
are now drowned in the modern reservoir,
but others still can be tasted. <br><br>
