A scow powered by oarsmen let Oregon
Trail wagons cross the Snake River here
from 1852 to 1870.<br><br>
Then overland stage service from Boise to
a rail terminal in Kelton, Utah, was
moved to this crossing, and M.E. Payne
installed a large (14-by-60-foot) new cable
ferry that used river current for power.
After stage service was shifted to a more
direct route at Glenn's Ferry in 1879, this
boat handled mostly local traffic until
1910, when it broke away and sank three
miles below here.
