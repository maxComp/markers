On May 27, 1806, Sgt. John Ordway and
Pvts. Frazer and Weiser were dispatched
from Camp Chopunnish (Kamiah) to
Lewis's River (Snake River) to obtain
salmon.<br><br>
Guided by Nez Perce Indians, the men
crossed the Camas Prairie near here. On
May 29, at a Salmon River Indian village,
Frazer traded an "old razer" to an Indian
woman for two Spanish mill dollars. They
reached the Snake River after descending
"the worst hills we ever saw a road make
down." They were welcomed by Nez
Perce and purchased a number of salmon.
