A gold rush to Montana brought steamboat service to Lake 
Pend Oreille City, two miles south of here on Buttonhook Bay. <br><br>
Traffic to 
British Columbia's Wild Horse mines also was attracted to 
this route, which provided a comfortable lake excursion for 
miners and freighters tired of packing over a long, rough trail. 
At its height, Pend Oreille City had two grocery stores, a 
billiard saloon, a hotel and a stable.
