Near the base of this hill, more than 100
cavalrymen and volunteers met disaster in
the opening battle of the Nez Perce War.<br><br>
Rushing from Grangeville on the evening
of June 16, 1877, Captain David Perry
planned to stop the Indians from crossing
the Salmon River to safety. At daylight the
next morning, he headed down the ravine
below you. Some 60 to 80 Indians wiped
out a third of his force and the survivors
retired in disorder. No Indians were
killed.
