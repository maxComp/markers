Flanked by rock formations more than 2.5 billion years old, 
these three granite peaks rose up in less than nine million 
years. <br><br>Very new as mountains go, they still are rising. 
Hinged at the base of the ridge before you, a block of rock 40 
miles long broke along a fault line, where the rock tipped up 
to become the top of the ridge. During the past 250,000 years, 
extensive glacial ice sculpted these spectacular peaks from the 
hard, resistant granite.
