<br><br>
By 1945, when the war ended, more than 400,000 prisoners had been 
sent to America.
<br><br>
Camps were built to house them in Idaho and other Western states. 
Camp Rupert, near Paul, Idaho, was the base camp for the southern 
part of the state, with about 15,000 POWs divided among branch 
camps at Aberdeen, Blackfoot, Emmett, Filer, Franklin, Gooding, 
Idaho Falls, Marsing, Nampa, Payette, Pocatello, Preston, Rigby, 
Shelley, Sugar City, Thomas, Upper Deer Flat, near Nampa and 
Wilder.
<br><br>
Others were located at Fort Hall, Gooding and Kooskia. Most prisoners
wanted to work at agricultural jobs and earn 80 cents or a dollar a 
day, rather than languish in camp. Farmers contracted for crews 
that were trucked to the fields in the morning and back to camp in 
the evening.
<br><br>
In February 1945, a POW camp attached to Farragut Naval Training 
Station on North Idaho's Lake Pend Oreille received 750 German and 
Austrian POWs.
