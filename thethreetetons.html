The giant peaks to the southeast were a
famous early Western landmark known to
fur hunters and mountain men.<br><br>
Perhaps as early as 1819, French-speaking 
trappers were calling them the Trois
Tetons - the three breasts. More prosaic
English-speaking mountain men named
them the Pilot Knobs, but the romantic
French name stuck. This is one of the
finest views of the peaks from the west,
the side from which they were seen by
the men who named them.
