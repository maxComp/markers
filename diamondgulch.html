In December 1865, Idaho's governor -
Caleb Lyon of Lyonsdale - set off a wild
rush to Diamond Gulch, visible a few
miles west of here, with a story that was
too good to be true.<br><br>
He told miners in Silver City that a
prospector had given him some priceless
diamonds from that area. Enough gems of
interest to rock hounds were found there
to maintain a diamond frenzy that winter.
A similar excitement followed in 1892,
but no actual diamonds ever were 
recovered in Diamond Gulch.
