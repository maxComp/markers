Whooping and yelling, Blackfeet Indians
and white trappers "fought like demons"
in the defile before you in 1823.<br><br>
After the Hudson's Bay Company trappers
burned the Indians out of a strong
position by starting a large brush fire, the
Blackfeet lost 10 warriors in a hot battle.
Though he came out the victor, Finnan
MacDonald decided that before he would
return to trap anywhere around here
again, "The beaver will have a gould
skin."
