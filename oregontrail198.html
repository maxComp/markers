A perilous ford at Three Island Crossing
State Park was a formidable Oregon Trail
barrier. <br><br>Those who could not cross here
faced a longer, more difficult southern
route.
No other ford between Missouri and
Oregon troubled them so much. This was
their largest river. Using two of three
islands, they crossed three channels, but
sometimes lost stock and wagons. Many
emigrants depended upon Shoshoni
Indian guides to get them across safely.
