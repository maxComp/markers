Thousands of eager miners came by here
in an 1864-65 gold rush to Wild Horse,
British Columbia. Parts of their pack trail
can still be seen.<br><br>
An extension of North America's earlier
gold excitements, Wild Horse was served
by pack trains that hauled supplies from
Columbia River steamboats and wagon
roads that connected with this trial. Some
packers used camel trains that made an
odd sight in this forested wilderness.
