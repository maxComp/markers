The Lost Gold Trails Loop ventures southwest through desert-lava 
rolling hill terrain along Highway A-2 where cattle and wild game 
peacefully share spring and fall months grazing. Arriving at the 
railroad tracks, which originated the town of "Dry Creek," later 
renamed Dubois, is also the historic Gateway to the Nez Perce Trail. 
The Trail continues west through town over 15 overpass onto Idaho 
22 to the Old Highway 91 Junction. Continue on Old Highway 91 to 
Spencer. This road is a favorite for hunters and fishermen. You 
will pass a U.S. Sheep Experiment Station historical sign and 
former entrance road. 
<br><br>
This early-day Gold Trail closely followed Beaver Creek towards 
Montana gold mines. At Spencer the Gold Trail of yesterday 
becomes the Opal Trails of today because of several high grade 
Opal Shops within the original Wood Live Stock town site. Leaving 
Spencer, the Trail heads east along the foothills of the Centennial 
Mountains towards Idmon.<br><br> Many years ago the Nez Perce used this 
trail to elude the U.S. Calvary. Today it is dedicated as the National 
Historic Nez Perce Trail and serves ranchers trailing or trucking 
cattle and sheep. Spurs off this main roadway trail to private opal 
mines, CaribouTarghee Forest, ranches, fishing, hunting, primitive 
camping areas, and an old area cemetery. It is known also as the 
home of Sandhill Cranes, Sage Grouse, many other wildlife species, 
and indudes beautiful fields of native plants, such as the well known 
Camas.
