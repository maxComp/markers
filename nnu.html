In 1913, Eugene Emerson started a
Christian school that his church developed
into an accredited college on a
campus he donated. <br><br>The college, located
on a campus 2 miles Southwest of here,
moved to university status in 1999.
Northwest Nazarene University continues
to maintain its church relationship as
reflected in its mission statement. "The
basic mission of Northwest Nazarene
University is the development of Christian
character within the philosophy and
framework of genuine scholarship."<br><br>
