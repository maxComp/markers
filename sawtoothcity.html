Gold discoveries on Beaver Creek in 1879 led to mining activity 
near here that summer. <br><br>But major production was 
delayed until 1886. By 1882, Sawtooth City had three saloons, 
two restaurants, a meat market, a store, a Chinese laundry, 
an assay office, a black-smith shop, two quartz mills, a sawmill 
and 80 or 90 construction workers building their town. Four 
more years went by, though, before miners worked out a system 
to process their gold ore. Although 200 miners were employed in 
1886, very little could be done after that. One disaster after 
another led to suspension of work there in 1892.<br><br>
