Sacajawea, an "Agaidika" Shoshone woman born around 1788, is 
known around the world as a trusted and valuable member of the 
famed Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery. 
<br><br>
A lesser-known fact, 
however, is her historical tie to Idaho's Lemhi Valley where she was
 born and raised until the age of twelve. Captured by the Arikira 
Indians and forced to live among them in the Mandan Villages of 
North Dakota, Sacajawea would not see her home again until 
becoming part of the Corps of Discovery in 1805. It was during this 
expedition that she would help Lewis and Clark find the Salmon 
River and revisit her people.
<br><br>
This passage through the high country of eastern Idaho 
offers a wealth of engaging stories, many of them considered 
historical legacies of Idaho and beyond. Found here are fossils of 
the extinct North American (or Pleistocene) lion, Native American 
rock art, the compelling stories of the Lemhi-Shoshone people, the 
Lewis and Clark expedition's passage through Sacajawea's homeland, 
the flight of the Nez Perce, the Reverend Samuel Parker, Fort Lemhi,
 the legacy of Chief Tendoy, stage routes and rail lines that served 
the mining boom of the late 1800's, and much more. Come discover 
for yourself what makes Sacajawea Historic Byway such a legacy.
