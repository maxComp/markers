On their westbound journey, Lewis and Clark crossed here, 
September 15, 1805, after camping four miles upstream at 
Powell. <br><br>Their Shoshoni guide had brought them down 
an old trail from Lolo Pass to a Lochsa fishery he knew about. 
To continue west, he had to take them north up this ridge to 
rejoin their Lolo Trail route. Indian travel through here had 
to go along high ridges because Lochsa Canyon had too many 
cliffs and gorges to provide a good horseback route.
