Free, clear, sparkling soda water still is
available in beautiful Soda Springs City
Park, located two miles from here.<br><br>
The prime attraction for more than 160
years, soda water from these springs was
marketed nationally after rail service
reached this resort area in 1882. W.H.
Hooper, Salt Lake City's leading banker
and president of Zion's Cooperative
Mercantile Institution, had his summer
home here. He did much to found and
promote Soda Springs and its soda water
industry while serving as Utah's delegate
to Congress.
