When Sun Valley Lodge was built in 1936, Union Pacific 
engineers developed chair lifts to transport skiers uphill. <br><br>
Starting with two modest ski slopes on Dollar Mountain and 
Proctor Mountain, chair lifts were used for all Sun Valley ski 
runs. Far superior to tow ropes and similar devices employed 
before 1936, they quickly became popular at ski resorts 
everywhere. New designs were adopted for additional Sun 
Valley ski runs, but one 1936-style chair lift still is preserved 
four miles up Trail Creek Road from here.
