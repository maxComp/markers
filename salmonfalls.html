In 1812, Joseph Miller found 100 lodges
of Indians spearing thousands of salmon
each afternoon at a cascade below here.
Each summer, they dried a year's supply.<br><br>
After 1842, they also traded salmon to
Oregon Trail emigrants. John C. Fremont
marveled at Salmon Falls' 18-foot vertical
drop, adjacent to "a sheet of foaming
water... divided and broken into cataracts"
by islands that "give it much picturesque
beauty and make it one of those places
that the traveler turns again and again to
fix in his memory."
