During a gun war that broke out between
company and union miners here, several
boxes of dynamite were exploded,
shattering a four-story mill, July 11, 1892.<br><br>
Overwhelmed by union miners, company
managers surrendered. Six fatalities -
half from each side - preceded four
months of martial law and military
occupation by 1,000 soldiers. A long
series of battles followed. Resumed in
North Idaho in 1899, this conflict continued
in Colorado, Montana, Nevada and
Arizona.
