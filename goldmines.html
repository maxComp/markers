More than a century ago, Rocky Bar,
Happy Camp and a number of other south
Boise mining towns flourished in a remote
mountain wilderness 30 miles northwest
of here.<br><br>
Discovered early in 1863, they were so
hard to get to that they could not be
worked successfully for more than 20
years. But wealthy investors from New
York and London finally put up enough
capital that large mills and underground
tunnels produced more than $6 million.
That gold now is worth more than $120
million.
