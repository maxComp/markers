This great institution began here on Sept.
22, 1902, with 4 teachers and 40 students.<br><br>
Originally the Academy of Idaho, it
became Idaho Technical Institute in 1915,
the Southern Branch of the University of
Idaho in 1927, and Idaho State College in
1947. Its development of professional and
graduate programs and its continued
growth in stature led to its designation as
a university in 1963. <br><br>
