An important Hudson's Bay Company fur
trade post was established in 1834, two
miles west of here on the bank of the Snake
River.<br><br>
Fur trading declined, but this British post
became famous for its hospitality to
American travelers on the Oregon Trail. An
1845 report spoke of "two acres of land
under cultivation - 1,991 sheep, 73 pigs,
17 horses and 27 meat cattle" - a welcome
oasis at the ford of the Snake River after 300
thirsty miles from Fort Hall. A flood in 1853
washed away the adobe buildings and
Indian trouble forced the company to
abandon the post two years later.
