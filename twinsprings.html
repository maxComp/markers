This was a major campground in the days of the California Gold Rush
after Hudspeth's Cutoff brought the trail by here in 1849.
 <br><br>
Except in wet seasons, there was no water for 22 miles 
to the east. Parties often had to travel late into the 
night across that rough country to reach these two 
great springs and avoid the hardships of a dry camp. 
From here they had two more tough ranges to cross 
before reaching the new perils of the Humboldt and 
high Sierra. You can still see their trail winding up 
to the west.
