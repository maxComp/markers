Most of Camas Prairie's wind-blown soil rests
upon Columbia River lava flows. <br><br>Coming
from a series of widespread eruptions, they
covered older, eroded granite rocks here
about six million to 17 million years ago.
Some earlier volcanic extrusions, including
the Kamiah Buttes (between which this
highway passes), rise above those Camas
Prairie lava flows. Perhaps older than 40
million years, they resemble volcanic rocks
from Challis, in south-central Idaho, rather
than newer lava from farther west. Geologists
still are studying how these buttes are related
to similar formations elsewhere in Idaho.
