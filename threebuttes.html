Rising above this level plain of lava flows
and windblown soils, these high landmarks
are recent additions to Idaho's
landscape.<br><br>
East Butte (farthest east) flowed up and
cooled quickly about 600,000 years ago ,
while Big Southern Butte (south of here)
emerged about 300,000 years ago .
Although East Butte and Middle Butte
have a similar general appearance, they
were formed in different ways. A dome of
melted rock called rhyolite that rose up
through a volcanic fissure became East
Butte. Middle Butte, however, is a block of
hard lava (basalt) pushed up by volcanic
activity from below.
