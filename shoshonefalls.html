Four miles east of here, the Snake River
falls thunders 210 feet over a rocky ledge
higher than famous Niagara.<br><br>
Indians, trappers and travelers all knew
the "Great Shoshonie." Now the waters
upstream have been harnessed for
irrigation and power, and in the dry
summer months the rocks can be seen.
The foaming river and the sheer walls of
the canyon combine with the paths and
shady lawns of the park and picnic area
to make it one of Idaho's most spectacular
scenes. At Shoshone Falls, a natural
textbook of earth's forces lies open for you.
