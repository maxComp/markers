<p>
In 1880, George Starrh, a Snake River
placer miner, started a ferry across the
Snake River one mile north of here.<br><br>
From 1880-82, freighters hauling supplies
for a mining rush to Wood River used
Starrh's ferry (powered by river current
when stiff winds were not blowing too
hard), and local traffic lasted until Milner
Reservoir flooded out summer operations
after 1904. But a small town with a post
office (1909-12) remained there for more
than a decade. During that time, nearby
bridges replaced Starrh's ferry.
