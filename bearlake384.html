Discovered in 1812 by trappers returning
home from Astoria, Oregon, this valley
and its large lake soon became an
important fur trade center.<br><br>
Donald Mackenzie, Jim Bridger and a
host of famous beaver hunters operated
here. Two major summer frolics and trade
fairs brought plenty of excitement to Bear
Lake in 1827 and 1828. Helping local
Indians repel Blackfoot invaders, those
trappers never forgot their wild festivals
here.
