Teton Valley was known originally as Pierre's Hole. <br><br>
Rich in beaver, it was a favorite stomping ground for British 
and American fur traders and trappers between 1819-40. 
"Old Pierre" Tevanitagon, an Iroquois Indian fur trapper for 
the Hudson's Bay Co., gave his name to this beaver-rich valley. 
Pierre's Hole was the scene of the annual rendezvous of 
mountain men and suppliers - The Great Rocky Mountain Fair - 
in 1832. That wild party ended in a free-for-all battle with 
the Gros Ventre Indians, which the trappers and their Indian 
friends won. The valley was permanently settled in 1882.
