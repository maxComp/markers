<p>
Glacial activity about 9,000 to 12,000
years ago created this lake out of what
previously had been the valley of a river.
<br><br>
The ice sheet occupied major valleys
north of here. As the glacier receded, melt
waters flooded across the outlet of this
valley, beyond modern Coeur d'Alene.
Rock, sand and gravel deposited there by
those floods raised the level of the land
and blocked the old river channel. This
backed up the river, submerged the valley
before you and produced one of Idaho's
lovely views.
