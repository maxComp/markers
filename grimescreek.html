Named for George Grimes, who with
Moses Splawn led the party that on
August 2, 1862, made the strike that
started the Boise Basin gold rush.<br><br>
The party was searching for a rich basin
described to Splawn a year earlier by an
Indian. Further up this creek, they found
the gold they were looking for. A few days
later, Grimes was killed at Grimes Pass (it
was blamed on Indians), and his partners
had to bury him in a prospect hole
nearby.
