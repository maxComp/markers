A long series of lava flows buried old
river channels in this area and created a
multitude of famous springs here.<br><br>
Over thousands of years, volcanic activity
created a vast valley and plain, slowly
forcing the Snake River southward in a
great curve. Successive river channels
were filled with spongy lava and became
underground reservoirs and conduits.
The Lost River and part of the Snake
River from near Rexburg slowly flow
through them. Torrents from these buried
channels now burst forth from this
canyon wall.
