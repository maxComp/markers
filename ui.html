Like this long highway, the University of
Idaho links together the northern and
southern parts of the state of Idaho.<br><br>
Established by the territorial legislature,
January 30, 1889, the university opened
in the fall of 1892. As Idaho's land grant
institution, the university was charged to
bring the benefits of quality teaching,
research and service to the people of
Idaho. Its eight colleges and graduate
school now serve thousands of students
and is a major center for higher education
in Idaho.<br><br>
