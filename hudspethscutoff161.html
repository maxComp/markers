Here, at a landmark called Sheep Rock, Hudspeth's Cutoff 
left the Oregon Trail and struck straight west to California.<br><br> 
Stampeding 49'ers would try anything to save miles and 
time in their rush for California gold. Earlier emigrant 
wagons headed northwest to Fort Hall, but on July 19, 1849, Benoni Hudspeth 
and John Myers led their party west along an old Indian trail 
they had checked out across rough country in 1848. Their 
difficult cutoff immediately became popular, though it saved 
only about 25 miles and two days' travel.
