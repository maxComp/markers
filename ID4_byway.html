A brief and oversimplified explanation of the Coeur d'Alene geology
states that 2.5 billion years ago the region was part of an extensive
shallow sea.  Streams eroded massive nearby mountain ranges and 
deposited them as fine sand in a slowly sinking basin.  Deposition
over hundreds of millions of years compacted the deeper layers
into dense rocks called argilite and quartzite.  These rocks 
designated the Belt Series, were formed before the advent of life
and therefore contain no fossils.<br><br>
Silver valley companies have been mining this area since 1884.
The best known of these are Hecla, Coeur d'Alene, Gem, Bunker Hill,
Frisco, Poorman and Star-Morning mines.
