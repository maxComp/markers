An important pioneer federal reclamation
dam and power plant provides water and
electricity for farms and cities nearby.<br><br>
Constructed five miles east of here
between 1904 and 1906 at a cost of
$675,000, Minidoka Dam diverts water
into canals 86 feet above the Snake River.
In order to reach still higher farms south
of Burley, a $413,000 power plant was
completed in 1913. Local irrigation
districts have repaid costs of this project.
This early federal power program led to
national Rural Electrification Administration
services.
