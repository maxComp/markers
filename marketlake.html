The flat, irrigated fields that stretch to the
next interchange used to be a great Indian
and trappers' hunting ground in an old
lake that came and went.<br><br>
In historic times, Market Lake was formed
during the great Snake River flood of
1853. When a new railroad grade blocked
the overflow channel leading from the
river, the lake disappeared for a time after
1887. Later, irrigation seepage restored
the lake, and now the level is regulated
for farming and a wildlife refuge.
