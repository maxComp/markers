On May 2, 1972, fire broke out in the
mine. <br><br>Carbon monoxide, heat, smoke and
gas spread quickly through the tunnels,
severely hampering rescue efforts.
One hundred seventy-six miners were
working at various levels. Eighty-five
made it out to safety. Seven days later, two
miners were found alive. On May 13, the
last of the 91 victims were brought out.
This was the country's worst hardrock
mine disaster since 1917. The Sunshine
Silver Mine is a mile deep and has 100
miles of tunnels.
