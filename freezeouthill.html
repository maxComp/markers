In 1862, Tim Goodale opened an Oregon
Trail cutoff that descended a steep ridge
just west of here into the valley below.<br><br>
Later that year a gold rush to Boise Basin
came up Payette Valley, and the next
summer farmers along the river started
raising crops to supply the mines. For a
year or more they were troubled by a
notorious band of horse thieves based at
Pickett's Corral located at the head of the
valley before you. Late in 1864, the
farmers organized the Payette Vigilance
Committee and drove out the Pickett
Corral gang.
