<br><br>Two separate volcanic events combined to create Upper Mesa Falls.
A volcanic eruption, 1.3 million years ago, covered the area with a thick layer 
of volcanic ash. Over time the ash compressed into tuff, forming the rock seen 
across the canyon. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the river eroded a wide
canyon through the tuff. Eventually, basalt lava flows filled the canyon and 
today provide the resistant rock layer over which the river flows. <br><br>As the 
falling water erodes the softer tuff below the basalt, large portions of basalt 
tumble into the river and Upper Mesa Falls slowly recedes upstream.  The 
volume of water flowing over the falls varies seasonally between 387 million to 
967 million gallons per day. Upper Mesa Falls is the largest undisturbed
waterfall in the entire Columbia River system.
