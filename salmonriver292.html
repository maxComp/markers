Rising as a small stream in the valley to the south, the Salmon 
River winds 420 miles across Idaho before flowing into the Snake 
River. <br><br>Discovered in 1805 by Meriwether Lewis and 
William Clark, and explored with great difficulty by fur traders 
and prospectors, the Salmon River drains a vast tangle of rugged 
mountains and deep canyons. Until 1950, boats could not ascend 
the main canyon, so the Salmon got the name "River of No 
Return." Large tracts of untamed wilderness still are found in 
the Salmon River Mountains.
