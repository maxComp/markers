After reaching the Boise River, emigrant
wagons had to travel 30 miles to find a
good crossing about 1/4 mile north of
here.<br><br>
They had to avoid a wide zone of shifting
channels, so they descended Canyon Hill,
where the route is still visible. In 1853,
Maria Belshaw "crossed Boise River at
ford, 15 rods wide 3 feet deep, beautiful
river, gravel bottom, very clear, large
salmon in it." After crossing, the road
headed westward along a route that
became U.S. 20.
