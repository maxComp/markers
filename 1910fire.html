More than two million acres of timber in
this area burned during an exceptionally
dry summer in 1910. <br><br>A gigantic firestorm
on August 20 did unprecedented damage.
Skies in Montreal and London were
blackened by its smoke, which interfered
with North Atlantic navigation. Strenuous
efforts saved most of Wallace from its
flames, but 85 firefighters were lost,
mostly in other areas. Edward Pulaski's
heroic measures to save his crew in a
nearby mine tunnel have become a forest
legend recounted in Wallace's mining
museum at 509 Bank Street.
