More than two decades before American Falls Dam 
was built, water power was generated in a series 
of plants at America Falls.<br><br>

Starting with an island plant to serve Pocatello in 1902,
 this superlative site was utilized soon after long 
transmission lines were developed. As new kinds of 
turbines and generators were invented, they were 
installed here. Rare examples of old technology 
still are preserved in these landmark plants.
