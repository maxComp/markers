    <b>Nez Perce (Nee-Me-Poo) National Historic Trail</b>
    <br><br>
Congress passed the National Trails System Act in 1968, establishing 
a framework for a nationwide system of scenic, recreational, and 
historic trails. The Nez Perce (Nimíipuu or Nee-Me-Poo) National 
Historic Trail stretches from Wallowa Lake, Oregon, to the Bear 
Paw Battlefield near Chinook, Montana. It was added to this system 
by Congress as a National Historic Trail in 1986.
<br><br>
The 1877 flight of the Nez Perce from their homelands while pursued 
by U.S. Army Generals Howard, Sturgis, and Miles, is one of the 
most fascinating and sorrowful events in Western U.S. history. 
Chief Joseph, Chief Looking Glass, Chief White Bird, Chief Ollokot, 
Chief Lean Elk, and others led nearly 750 Nez Perce men, women, 
and children and twice that many horses over 1,170 miles through 
the mountains, on a trip that lasted from June to October of 1877.
<br><br>
Forced to abandon hopes for a peaceful move to the Lapwai reservation
, the Nez Perce chiefs saw flight to Canada as their last promise for
 peace. The flight of the Nez Perce began on June 15, 1877. Pursued 
by the Army, they intended initially to seek safety with their Crow 
allies on the plains to the east. Their desperate and circuitous route 
as they tried to escape the pursuing white forces is what we now call 
the Nez Perce National Historic Trail.
<br><br>
It enters Idaho at Lewiston and cuts across north-central Idaho, 
entering Montana near Lolo Pass. It then travels through the 
Bitterroot Valley, after which it re-enters Idaho at Bannock Pass.
