When he came to Lewiston in 1867,
Father J.M. Cataldo developed a Jesuit
Nez Perce mission that continued long
after he founded Gonzaga University in
Spokane.<br><br>
A chapel was built a mile up Mission
Creek in 1868, but a permanent location
was not established until construction of
Saint Joseph's Mission was completed at a
more secluded site in 1874. It now is open
to visitors as part of the Nez Perce
National Historical Park.
