<p>
Indians have lived next to this good fishing hole for 10,000 
years. As long as 3,000 years ago, they had large oval houses, 
28 feet long by 24 feet wide. <br><br>To build these 
houses, they put a bark and mat covering over a frame of 
50 or so house posts. Four or more families lived in a house 
this size. From their village here by the river, they went out 
to hunt deer or to dig camas. They had to travel widely in 
their constant search for food.
