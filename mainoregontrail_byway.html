Starting at the crossing of the Snake River, you will follow the route 
of the pioneers as they crossed the Idaho desert in a covered wagon 
pulled by weary oxen. Travelers can walk in the ruts created by 
thousands of emigrants in search of new homes in Oregon and visit the 
historic sites of the emigrant diaries. Much of this route appears 
today as it did when the emigrants traveled this route. 
<br><br>
The main Oregon Trail from Three Island Crossing of the Snake River
to the Boise River was the primary route utilized by the emigrants 
for the first 10 years of the Trail. Thousands of pioneers struggled 
across the dusty sagebrush-covered plains of Idaho with their 
possessions in a covered wagon. 
<br><br>
Freight and stage roads utilized much of the Oregon Trail as they 
developed. Travelers and freighters continued to use the route 
long after the building of the railroads across southern Idaho, 
even into the early 1900's. The Idaho desert proved to be some of 
the most dangerous and difficult travel the pioneers endured on
their long journey.
