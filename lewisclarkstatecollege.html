Lewis Clark State College was created by
the Legislature in 1893 as a two-year
normal school to train teachers.<br><br>
After more than half a century of growth,
Lewiston State Normal School expanded
into a four-year college in 1947. An area
vocational school and a nursing education
program were added in 1965. Designated a
state college in 1971, Lewis Clark continues
to specialize in teacher education.<br><br>
