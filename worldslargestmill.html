Potlatch Lumber Company Sawmill built here in 1906 was one of the largest in the world.<br><br>
Expanding operations to the West, Weyerhaeuser timber barons 
invested in Idaho's prime white pine stands. By 1920 their mill was cutting 175 million board feet each year.
Logs and lumber were moved by the Washington Idaho and Montana
Railway through stations uniquely named for eastern colleges: Yale, Princeton, Harvard,
Cornell, Purdue.
