Henry Harmon Spaulding established
Idaho's earliest mission near here,
November 29, 1836, at a campsite chosen
by the Nez Perce Indians.<br><br>
Ever since they met Lewis and Clark in
1805-06, the Nez Perce had wanted to find
out more about the white man's ways. In
1831, a Nez Perce delegation went all the
way to St. Louis, where they saw Clark
again and asked for teachers. Spaulding
came west to answer their call. With Indian
help, a house and assembly hall were built
in 24 days. In two months, Mrs. Spaulding
started a mission school. In 1838, the
mission was moved north to the Clearwater.
