Started May 13, 1861, as a steamboat
landing, Lewiston immediately became a
primary commercial center for Idaho
miners during their hectic gold rush to
Pierce that spring.<br><br>
Steamboats continued to dock there until
1940, mainly after Columbia and Snake
River channel improvements made
navigation practical in 1914. Finally, a
series of locks and dams made Lewiston a
seaport and large scale river shipping
resumed in 1975.
