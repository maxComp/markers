Known as Goddin's River in the days of
the fur trade, this stream originally was
named for the fur trapper who discovered
it.<br><br>
Thyery Goddin, a prominent Iroquois
who explored this river in 1819 or 1820,
had come here with Donald Mackenzie's
fur hunters who worked for the North
West Company of Montreal. Well stocked
with beaver until it was trapped out in
1824, Goddin's River offered a wealth of
furs to early trappers. Then, after the fur
trade was over, the river's original name
was forgotten. Later settlers called it the
Lost River because it sinks into the desert
lava.
