Long before fur hunters explored here in
1811, an annual Indian festival was held
each July in this area.<br><br>
Indian people came great distances to
trade and celebrate and arrange intertribal
marriages. Cheyenne and Arapaho bands
brought elegant tipi poles from Colorado.
Crow and Shoshoni buffalo hunters
supplied meat and hides from Montana
and Wyoming. Nez Perce and Walla Walla
horsemen marketed superior stock they
had developed, and Paiute weapon and
toolmakers provided obsidian from
central Oregon. All were attracted to this
river area for its excellent salmon fishing.
