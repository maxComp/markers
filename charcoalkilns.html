Charcoal for a smelter, active from 1885-89
across the valley at Nicholia, was produced
in 16 kilns six miles west of here.<br><br>
Discovered in 1881, the Viola mine became
an important source for lead and silver
from 1886-88. Ore also was hauled from
Gilmore to the Viola smelter. British capital
kept the Viola mine going until 1889,
when the hoisting works burned. Low
prices for lead and silver kept the smelter
shut down after 1889, and charcoal
production ceased here. You are invited to
take a self-guided tour of the kilns,
provided by the Targhee National Forest.
