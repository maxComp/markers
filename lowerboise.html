Confederate refugees from Missouri
started farming in this area in 1863 and
1864, when gold and silver mining camps
created a great demand for flour and
cattle.<br><br>
Driven out from their Missouri River
homes below Kansas City by extremely
bitter Civil War border warfare, they got a
new start by digging riverside canals and
planting crops. They helped make Idaho
an overwhelmingly southern Democratic
territory from 1864 to 1880. Settlements
from Caldwell to Notus were known as
Dixie, and those farther west were called
Lower Boise.
