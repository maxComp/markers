Ricks College commenced as a Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints stake academy in 1888. <br><br>Ricks was 
first known as Bannock Stake Academy, then Remont Stake 
Academy, Smith Academy and Ricks Academy before becoming 
Ricks College in 1918. The name memorializes Thomas E. Ricks, 
founder of Rexburg in 1883. Today Ricks College, Idaho's largest 
private college, includes a modern campus surrounding the 
historic 1903 Jacob Spori building.<br><br>
