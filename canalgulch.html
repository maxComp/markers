The famous gold rush days of Idaho began on September 30, 
1860, when W.F. Bassett struck gold just about here. <br><br>
E.D. Pierce, who knew the country, had led 12 prospectors, 
including Bassett, out from Walla Walla in August. After 
news of the strike spread, about 60 men came in and wintered 
nearby in spite of snow and Indians. Next spring the stampede 
was on and by that July this six-month-old county cast the 
largest vote in Washington Territory.
