When the Nez Perce named this site, they viewed a 
desolate yet beautiful landscape.<br><br>
Near a large island at the confluence, crystal waters 
from the Clearwater joined the murky flow of the 
Snake.  Scattered willows grew along the broad river 
banks.  Grass-covered, treeless hills defined the 
perimeter.  Today, a dam to the west elevates the 
rivers forty feet above their beds.
