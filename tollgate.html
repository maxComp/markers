An 1868 toll road to Rocky Bar provided
better access to early gold mines 40 miles
north of here.<br><br>
Julius Newberg's south Boise wagon road
had reached Rocky Bar in 1864, but a
route through this canyon was needed to
avoid steep Syrup Creek grades on
Goodale's Cutoff eight miles northwest of
here. Tolls were collected here for 20
years to maintain it, and James Porter's
splendid hotel and dairy attracted travelers
for many miles.
