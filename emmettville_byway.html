Originally called "Emmettville," it was primarily a post office named 
after Emmett Cahalan, the son of Tom Cahalan, an early settler of 
the area. The post office was later moved but retained the name. A 
few years later the "ville" was dropped and the post office and town 
became simply Emmett. 
<br><br>
In 1883 James Wardwell had the town platted, and in 1900 the town 
was incorporated as Emmett. Later, in March 1902, the Idaho 
Northern railroad came to the valley.
