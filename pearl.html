Long after its discovery in 1867, a mining
camp flourished next to a gold lode below
Crown Point on this ridge 4 miles west of
here.<br><br>
Pearl boasted 3 stores, 4 saloons, a
butcher shop, a fire station, a church, a
school, 2 hotels, and an Odd Fellows'
Lodge before it declined. A revival was
considered as late as 1882, when high
gold prices had increased Pearl's early
production value to $12,000,000.
