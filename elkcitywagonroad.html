A scenic 1895 wagon road from Harpster to Elk City 
gave freighters and travelers better 
access across high ridges and rugged terain
to isolated mining camps.<br><br>
Sections of the steep, narrow road run close to a much older 
Nez Perce trail that led to Montana's buffalo country and the 
Snake River Plain. Nez Perce travelers have utilized the route 
since obtaining horses, which made long distance hunting and 
other excursions possible. Missionary Samuel Parker was 
guided over portions of the route in 1835 by the Nez Perce.
