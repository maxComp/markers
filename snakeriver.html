The valley of the snake, historic passage
from the Midwest to the Northwest, has
been a primary route for travel since the
days of Indians and fur traders.<br><br>
The Oregon Trail forded the river at Old
Fort Boise, the Hudson's Bay Co. post 23
miles upstream. Many a famous early
westerner saw the valley you now see -
though the look of the land has changed
since white settlement brought irrigated
farms. Today the river provides both
irrigation and power along its 1,000-mile
course from the Yellowstone country to the
Columbia River. Highways, railroads and
airlines follow its open valley east of here;
but to the north, Hells Canyon of the Snake
River is still almost impassable to man.
