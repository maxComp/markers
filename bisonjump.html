Before settlers came to Idaho in 1860, buffalo used to roam 
through this valley. <br><br>Most of them had left here by 
1840. After they acquired Spanish horses, 18th-century 
Shoshoni buffalo hunters could drive a small herd over a cliff 
to make their work easier. Directly north of here, an old 
buffalo jump, used before mining commenced in this region, 
can be clearly seen. Archaeologists also have found stone 
weapon factories near it.
