Marcus Whitman and Henry Harmon Spalding led Presbyterian 
missionaries west in 1836 to answer a Nez Perce call for teachers.
<br><br> Spalding began his mission and school nearby, but 
moved here in 1838. Believing in secular as well as religious 
teaching, he taught the Indians farming, brought in the 
Northwest's first printing press, and built flour and sawmills. 
But hostility slowly developed, and Spalding left after the 
Whitman massacre at Walla Walla in 1847. He returned with 
the gold rush to labor among his converts until his death in 1874.
 His grave is  nearby.
