On Idaho highway 33 is the Fort Henry Monument that marks the first 
European 
settlement in Idaho, from which this byway gets its name. A 
new monument replaces the old one. The old monument has been 
moved to the original Fort Henry site in the adjoining field. It can 
be viewed from the new monument via telescope.
<br><br>
From the Monument the byway heads to the St. Anthony Sand 
Dunes. The dunes are part of the Sand Mountain Wilderness Study 
Area. This 20,000-acre area of sage and juniper is the winter range 
for a large number of deer and elk.
<br><br>
In April, Camas Meadows is host to returning Sandhill Cranes. The 
area is home to Sage Grouse that gather each spring for a courtship 
ritual at their display ground. June brings forth fields of blue Camas 
Lilies. The Indians dug the Camas bulbs in the fall for food. Mountain 
streams are enticing for fisherman and campers. The mountains of 
the Caribou Targhee National Forest lure both hikers and bicyclists.
<br><br>
The heritage of Clark and Fremont counties is very unique and full 
of early history of mountain men, Indians, miners, stagecoach lines, 
and ranching. A destination site on this byway is the Camas Meadows
 Battleground where a skirmish occurred between the U.S. Calvary 
and the Nez Perce during their 1877 flight.
