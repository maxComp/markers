In 1942, a large United States naval training station, with 
facilities for 40,000 sailors, opened here. <br><br>From 1946 
to 1949, it became Farragut College. When postwar college 
enrollments slacked off, Farragut State Park was developed 
here, with accommodations adequate for an International 
Boy Scout Jamboree in 1967, as well as for national Boy Scout 
and Girl Scout camping experiences. Idaho's largest state 
park offers an attractive lakeshore setting for thousands of 
visitors each year. <br><br>
