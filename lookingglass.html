During General 0. 0. Howard's  1887 Nez Perce campaign, 
Looking Glass and his band were camped up Clear Creek 
near here. <br><br>Looking Glass told Army authorities: 
"Leave us alone. We are living here peacefully and want 
no trouble." But after a July 1 military attack that destroyed 
his village, ruined his gardens and captured 750 Nez Perce 
horses, Looking Glass and his band joined other Nez Perce 
refugees and soon headed for Montana's buffalo plains. 
Howard spent three more months pursuing Joseph, White 
Bird, Looking Glass and their warriors after that fiasco.
