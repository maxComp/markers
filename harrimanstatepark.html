Started in 1902 as a large cattle ranch,
Railroad Ranch soon became a summer
retreat for wealthy Easterners and
eventually Idaho's largest state park.<br><br>
Railroad magnate and diplomat W
Averell Harriman and his brother Roland
donated the ranch to Idaho in 1977, thus
preserving the area's remarkable wildlife,
and prompting development of a professionally
managed state parks system.<br><br>
