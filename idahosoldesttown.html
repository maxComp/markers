Franklin was settled April 14, 1860, by
Mormon pioneers. <br><br>The free local museum
exhibits a large collection of tools and
relics of pioneer days.
The founding of Franklin was part of a
well organized plan of Mormon
expansion. Church authorities sent the
colonists under Thomas Smart from
Provo, Utah. Men of many trades were
included in order to make the community
self-sufficient. From 1874-77, Franklin
was the busy terminus of the Utah
Northern Railroad, where freight for the
Montana mines was reloaded for the long
wagon haul north.<br><br>
