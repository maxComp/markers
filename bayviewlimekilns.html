Large kilns that produced lime from 1904 to 1932 still can be 
visited in Bayview, about two miles from here. <br><br>
Production of lime for nearby mines and Spokane buildings
 commenced in this area as soon as rail transportation and
 markets became available. For 14 years after 1887, steamboats 
hauled lime to a Northern Pacific Railway dock at Hope. When 
an interurban rail connection reached here in 1911, lime for 
cement products was exported from Bayview until an economic 
depression destroyed regional demand for concrete.
