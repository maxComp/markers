<p>
A network of Pacific Northwest logging
railroads hauled timber from rough
mountain country to local sawmills for
several decades prior to 1940.<br><br>
Owned by timber companies, these lines
used small, powerful locomotives that
could climb 10% grades and negotiate
very sharp curves. An Ohio Match
Company engine that used to operate
near here is now included in a Potlatch
Company display in Lewiston.
