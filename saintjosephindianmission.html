On November 4, 1842, Father Nicholas
Point began Jesuit mission that settled
here after a winter at Coeur d'Alene.<br><br>
Eagerly sought by the Coeur d'Alene
Indians, the black-robed missionaries
supervised the building of a log cabin and
in the spring began to teach "the mysteries
of plowing and planting." Soon, two thirds
of the tribe was baptized. But floods
gave trouble here and in 1846, the
mission moved north to Cataldo.
