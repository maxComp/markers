Built as a model town, Potlatch was owned by Weyerhaeuser's
Polatch Lumber Company.<br><br>
Spokane architect C. Ferris White designed the new community in 1905.
Workers housing stood close to the mill.  Managers homes were built away
from the the plant's noise and smoke.  The railroad depot seperated town from industry.
 All company owned, Potlatch was complete with church's, school,
gym, hospital, opera house and company store.
