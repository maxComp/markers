The boat was built in 1866 to provide
easy river travel for a part of the route
from the Columbia River to Boise and
Silver City.<br><br>
It was intended to ply 105 miles between
here and Old's Ferry. Once it even
explored the river for 60 miles above here,
astonishing the jackrabbits with its
amibitious whistle. But business was poor,
and firewood for boilers was scarce.
Service stopped after a few trips. Finally,
in a hair-raising ride, the 136-foot, 300-
ton boat was run through Hells Canyon to
the Columbia.
