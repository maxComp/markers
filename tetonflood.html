When the Teton Dam suddenly washed away, June 4, 1976, 
a large reservoir of water (280 feet deep) was dumped on farms
 and towns below. <br><br>Houses floated away, and cropland 
was ruined as water surged into the Snake River and American 
Falls Reservoir, which finally controlled the flood. Church, 
government and disaster relief agencies responded effectively, 
but 14 lives were lost, and hundreds of millions of dollars in 
damage resulted from that unforgettable calamity. All that 
remains of Teton Dam still can be seen from a viewpoint two 
miles north of here.
