On their eastbound journey, the Corps of Discovery and
 several Nez Perce reached the Nezperce Prairie from 
present-day Peck on May 8, 1806, and camped on "a 
Small hansom Stream".<br><br>
On May 9 the party arrived at the root-digging camp 
of Twisted Hair on the Nezperce Prairie. From here, 
Pvt. Willard accompanied Twisted Hair and two of 
his young men to the Clearwater River to retrieve 
saddles, gunpowder and horses left the previous 
October. On May 10, the Corps traveled southeast 
16 miles across an open and snowy prairie, passing 
within a mile of Nezperce, before descending into 
Lawyers Canyon enroute to Chief Broken Arm's camp
 near Kamiah. St. Ordway and Privates Frazer and 
Weiser passed within a mile south of Nezperce on 
May 27 on their way to Salmon River to obtain fish.
