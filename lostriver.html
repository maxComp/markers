When its water is not diverted for upstream
irrigation, the Lost River flows
past here into a sink 14 miles to the
northeast.<br><br>
Lava flows in the Snake River plains
buried old channels of the Lost River,
Little Lost River and Birch Creek. No
longer able to reach the Snake River on
the surface, they went underground. After
a 120-mile journey under the lava plains,
water from the Lost River eventually
emerges through numerous large springs
below Twin Falls, making up a small part
of the flow of Thousand Springs near
Hagerman.
