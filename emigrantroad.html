More than a century ago, fur trappers and
emigrants followed an old Indian trail that
crossed here on its way to Oregon.<br><br>
Hudson's Bay Co. traders preferred this
route between Fort Hall and Fort Boise,
but early emigrant wagons had to travel a
road south of the Snake River until ferries
and road improvements let wagons come
this way. Shoshone Falls - known until
1849 as Canadian Falls to British and
French trappers - was a spectacular
attraction along this road.
