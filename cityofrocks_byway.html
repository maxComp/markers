Forming a 49-mile necklace around the Albion Mountain Range, the 
City of Rocks Back Country Byway traces a rural landscape steeped
 in history and geological significance.
 <br><br>
Beginning in Albion on Idaho 77, the byway traverses the outskirts 
of the Pomerelle Ski Area and Lake Cleveland Recreation Area as it 
heads south. At the base of the byway's necklace lies its jewel, the 
City of Rocks National Reserve, where more than 700 challenging 
climbs rival Yosemite National Park and make it a favorite spot 
among technical rock climbers worldwide. The visitor Center in 
Almo provides travel information, and a series of wayside exhibits 
through the park interpret the historic California Trail migration 
from 1843 through 1869.
<br><br>
Heading north, the last leg of the byway ends in historic Oakley; 
the entire town, in fact, is on the National Register of Historic 
Places and features the state's largest concentration of old stone 
and wood-framed buildings.
