The Old Toll Road to Idaho City crossed
the ridge from Boise through the lowest
point you can see in the skyline across the
valley.<br><br>
Climbing the More's Creek canyon wall, it
crossed this highway about here and
swung north. The road was built, and
stage services began in 1864 when Idaho
City was the largest town in the Pacific
Northwest. Even though the road was
shorter than today's highway, it was a
long, hard day's trip from Boise to Idaho
City. A stage from this run is in the Idaho
Historical Museum.
