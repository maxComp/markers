U.S. commercial airline service began
with a Varney Air Lines flight from Pasco
to Boise, which landed here April 6, 1926.
Army planes had delivered airmail before
that time.<br><br>
After Varney Air Lines was merged with
newer companies to become United
Airlines, this flight was recognized as
United's initial flight. A year later, Charles
A. Lindbergh landed here on national tour
after his solo flight to Paris. Boise's
municipal airport continued to serve
planes here until 1940, when 8,800-foot
runways were built at its present site.
