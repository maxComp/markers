After Warren P. Callahan located a rich lead-silver mine here, 
April 26, 1879, thousands of eager treasure-hunters joined in 
a rush to Wood River in 1880. <br><br>
Successful prospectors discovered valuable lodes from here 
to Bellevue. Galena had a  hotel, four general stores, a livery 
stable, several saloons and dining halls, a shoe store, and 
daily stage service to Hailey. After a ruinous decline in silver 
prices in 1888, its mines were shut down. But Galena continued
 as a recreation center.
