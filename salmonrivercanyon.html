Some 15 million years ago, the Salmon
River ran across great Miocene lava flows
above here and started to carve this deep
canyon.<br><br>
Then this part of the earth's surface
gradually rose. As the mountains were
rising, the river cut down into the older
rock below. Many other Northwestern
rivers cut similar gorges. The Snake River
flows through Hells Canyon - deepest of
them all - eight miles west of here.
