The Pend Oreille (pon-der-ay) Scenic Byway offers travelers some of 
Idaho's most spectacular water views. Beginning at the intersection 
with U.S. 95, Idaho 200 meanders eastward to the Montana state 
line across farmlands, through river deltas, and along the rocky 
northern shores of Lake Pend Oreille, all sculpted by the massive 
force of glaciers and the floodwaters of Glacial Lake Missoula. 
Pullouts along the byway allow visitors to stop and enjoy breathtaking
 vistas of mountainous horizons framing miles of open water. 
 <br><br>
Four-season recreational opportunities begin along the shores of the 
lake and reach across the vast regions of national forest overlooking 
the Pend Oreille Scenic Byway. Whether you are inclined to swim 
or fish, boat or golf, hunt or hike mountain trails, alpine ski or 
snowmobile, water ski or bird watch,  each of our distinctive four 
seasons offers an outstanding recreational opportunity for almost 
every person who enjoys the outdoors. Visitors can find varying 
accommodations from unimproved mountain campsites to maintained 
shoreline campgrounds to recreational vehicles parks along the water
 or choose from lakefront resorts or motels.
