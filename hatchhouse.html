In 1874, Bishop L.H. Hatch built a
mansion that has been preserved as a fine
example of pioneer Idaho architecture.<br><br>
Idaho's only railroad, serving Montana's
thriving mining camps, reached here that
year during a time of depression between
gold rushes. At the time, Franklin was
Idaho's largest city. Two years later, rail
construction resumed, and freighters
moved on. But Hatch's elegant house
remains as a reminder of a bygone era.
